I was the IEEE Student Chair during my undergraduate study and have organized competitions, fund raisers, hackathons and seminars. I have also had some experience with organizing events like coding competitions and school fests.

Coming into my last semester of my Master's program, I know how important Career Development is, especially not an international student. By organizing events that focus on necessary skills, like communication and resume building, having alumni coming in to share their experiences and inviting companies to talk about what they are looking for, I hope to encourage students that are (or will be) actively looking for jobs, to put their best foot forward.
My second choice is Interschool. I have previously been in positions where I have had to coordinate between schools to come up with fun events, like music or food festivals or hackathons, to meet people from different schools.
My third preference is the Social committee. Life at Columbia can get pretty stressful, so I hope to be able to organize socials that are a fun time to let your hair down and hopefully go beyond bar-hopping.

I like organizing events and working in a team and would really like to use my spare time this semester to go beyond academics and let loose!

In college, I was part of the Web Team in the UG Academic Council. First, I was a coordinator and then I was the Manager, which translates to me being the head of the team. Leading a team of 4, I was in charge of all web- and digital-media-related initiatives and activities of the Undergraduate Academic Council.

I was also a Core Team Member of Google Developer Group, Mumbai. I helped organise many of the group's events in IIT Bombay.

Career Development:
- Coordinate with the Alumni Affairs Committee and conduct alumni panels and mixers to give students a chance to interact and network with illustrious Columbia alumni.
- Invite more companies for tech talks and office hours to assist students in their job and internship hunting.
- Collaborate with the Center for Career Education and organise resume workshops, mock interviews and other such sessions for the benefit of the students.

Academic Affairs
- Create better communication channels for students to raise their concerns. Possible solutions could include an open house between students and their faculty (department-wise), anonymous surveys.
- Invite a select group of students for meetings with the Dean to further voice their concerns.

Digital Media
- Expand the presence and reach of EGSC on Facebook and Twitter.
- Work with CUIT to resolve the domain issues.
- Make the website more comprehensive.

I have been involved in planning events in my undergrad. I was the chief coordinator for my college's Technical Festival for two years. I was mainly responsible for the marketing of the event and sponsorship. Besides this, I have volunteered for various events in the past semester in Columbia.

I believe networking and building strong connections is an integral part of EGSC. I would love to get the non members more involved in the various events EGSC hosts. Whether it's the socials or  alumni meets or career advice, every one can contribute in some way or the other. Good career advice and mentoring can only be achieved if  there are more participants. The last time i attended the peer mentoring event, I realized that a lot of questions asked (by the new students, related to computer science) were track and course specific, and were not able to get accurate answers. For example, there should be at least two - three mentors for each track. As mentioned before, the only way we could achieve something like this is, is if we get everyone involved in these events. 
Taking feedback after the events would also be another step that could help EGSC prosper. 

All in all, I believe I have a lot to offer , and at the same time would love meeting new people, and learn from the experiences.

I love to get people connected closer to each other  and enjoy social interactions.  It's exciting to work on events and programs that bring in alumni and people outside the department/school and provide opportunities for students to establish a broad network stretching out into the society outside school.
