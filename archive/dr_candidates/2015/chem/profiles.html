I would like to help my fellow graduate students by focusing on professional development to equip them for their dream jobs.  I propose the following:
- Work in collaboration with CCE and Department Placement Coordinator to conduct sessions on relevant industries and their skill requirements
- Facilitate the communication between the alumni and the graduate students
- Organize guest lectures and discussion sessions involving Alumni from relevant industries
- Coordinate with other department representatives to learn about other initiatives

In my undergraduate career, I was involved with the Chemistry Student Council as a community outreach chair promoting career development in chemistry. My responsibilities included engaging middle and high school students in scientific demonstrations to stimulate early interest in the field. I want to help promote the EGSC chapter at Columbia by providing resources and support to the graduate students so that they can succeed academically and advance professionally.
<br><br>

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
As a Chemical Engineering Department Representative, I would fulfill the expectation to listen to the voices of the engineering graduate students, communicate their ideas effectively to the board, and promote EGSC events in a timely manner. My goals and visions for the EGSC Career Development committee include facilitating relationships among engineering students, faculty, and industry representatives. Events I would be eager to plan are company informational sessions, professional speakers, plant tours, and resume/networking workshops.
<br><br>
      
     <h4 class="team-member-name">Any other information you would like to share</h4>
The benefits of meeting more engineers through EGSC will allow me to further engage in my field, and I would be honored to guide the chapter to excellence. In addition to my enthusiasm for EGSC, my skills include active listening, diligence, responsibility, and initiative to get things done, as well as a solid foundation of professional outreach experience.

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
I aim to contribute to the society by helping in organizing events,planning new ones which shall help the engineering fraternity to come together to discuss and deliberate on current trends. Social life is as important as work, and I look forward to helping the society organize such events by giving useful inputs, coordinating and executing tasks, which shall help in successful conducting the events.

During my undergrad, I was a Resident Advisor (RA) which allowed me to deal with large student populations and interact with students on a professional and personal level. I had organized a multitude of events that were relevant to academic, professional, and social development. I have also worked in a research lab which has given me much insight into working with faculty members and a glimpse into the world of academia.
<br><br>

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
My goals and vision for the committees I have preferred are to keep an open line of communication between EGSC and the graduate student body. While much of the work that is done in each committee is significantly important to the success of EGSC, I believe it is equally important that the information is readily available for all relevant parties. A goal I hope to achieve is increasing membership to EGSC and attendance to the events. One way I believe this is possible is by having a weekly or monthly tabling for students in a public space (ex. Carleton Lounge) in where events that are being held can be advertised or just an open Q&A session.

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
Following are is the vision I have for the committee and the  ways in which I believe I would be able to contribute to the committee of my choice:

1. I would like to help the  EGSC in hosting at least 5 mock technical interviews for students interested in working in the Chemical/Pharma/ Energy sector with the help of the alumni of the departments. I would also like to help arrange for discussions/ tech talks with various companies which sponsor visa to international students to help them secure jobs and internships. 

2. Given a chance to be a representative for the social committee, I would encourage more students to dedicate their time to teaching (if permitted) in schools for underprivileged students in and around NYC. I would like to see the computer engineers teaching coding basics, the chemical engineering students teaching chemistry projects, the civil engineering students helping school kids build models of buildings etc. I would be happy to be actively involved in conducting and arranging outreach programs throughout the year. 

3. I would be glad to assist students with their academic problems- ranging from getting the right books from the library, to being able to access certain software on the campus that is not otherwise free etc. I would willingly do any administrative job that is expected of me as a representative.

I was elected the school head-girl back in 2009 and was responsible for the discipline and behavior of 250 girls from class V to class X. 
I am responsible, punctual, enthusiastic and innovative. I also have good communication skills. Hence I believe that I am a perfect fit to be the representative of the department for EGSC. Thank you.
