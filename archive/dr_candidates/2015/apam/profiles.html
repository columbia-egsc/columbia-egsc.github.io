Networking with the right people in Graduate School is the most important task for a successful future. I would like to build a bigger alumni network for the students not just to serve the committy well but also for the APAM department, where I feel it is not really stressed upon. Being a Graduate student, I understand the kind of doubts and queries we have regarding the industry, So along with the regular alumni sessions, I will try to organise Question-Answer sessions with people for a better and more personal interaction with the alumnus.

Firstly, enhancing communications and coordinations among all students will be beneficial.Secondly, we should be deep into society finally, so to set up a clear plan for career is helpful. I will feel regretful if I cannot get the chance to service the students, staff and alumnus.

During my undergraduate degree in the UK I was for two consecutive years (2011-2013) a member of the Cambridge University Cypriot Society, as an IT and then as a Vice-President of the committee. In my position as an IT representative I was serving the role of providing the means of communication between the committee and the members of the society, while I also promoting the society through the internet by contacting new students and bringing them in direct contact with the rest of the society. As a Vice-President I was responsible for planning a number of events ranging from socials with board games to nights out in clubs, which involved the responsibilities of creating the schedule of events, booking deals with venues, managing budgets and collecting useful feedback from the members for future improvements. Between 2013-2014 I was also a representative for my year of the Staff-Student Committee member of the Chemical Engineering Cambridge Department. As a member of this committee I had the opportunity to formally express the ideas and complains of my classmates about the department and the courses and try to work out alternatives together with the Professors involved in the committee about the different issues.

As a member of the Alumni Affairs committee I will get the chance to contribute towards the organisation of a number of events based on students' requests and preferences that will bring students in direct contact with Alumni. Such events can vary from Alumni talks that followed an engineering-based career path after their graduate program in Columbia to events based on Alumni that followed a number of non-engineering related career paths after Columbia. In this way we will be able to meet successful people in their careers and get ideas about the different alternatives that one can seek in the job market. Alumni affairs committee can also work closer with the Center for Career Education to contact Alumni and provide the opportunity for graduate engineers to have a more direct access to Alumni through EGSC.
