I was elected the Student Body President in High School during my senior year; during the same period I also served as the founder President of the Quiz Club, the Programming Head of the Computers Club and a Member of the Editorial Board.
In my undergrad, I was on the Executive panel of the quiz club and helped getting it recognized officially by the college. As a council member of one of the largest student chapters of IEEE in Asia (IEEE DTU), I helped organize one of the biggest Techfests in India - TROIKA 2013. My job also involved taking initiatives and setting up a program to get more people interested in programming; I served as an instructor and held several workshops to introduce freshmen to C/C++ and basic algorithms.
As an executive member of ENACTUS (formerly SIFE), I designed and implemented Project &#039;CHHAAP&#039; and helped DTU win the ENACTUS India 2013 Competition. The team eventually reached the Semi-Finals at the ENACTUS WORLD CUP 2013 in Mexico.

I have a couple of things to begin with: first, the course registration process could be made much smoother. I have heard that&#039;s much better than last year, however, it&#039;s been difficult to find courses of my choice because either they clash with the ones I already have or they&#039;re restricted for my department or there&#039;s already a huge waitlist. This is something that a lot of incoming graduate students have complained about, most of us picked Columbia for a few specific courses and it&#039;s quite unfortunate that those courses already had a huge waitlist even before the registration was opened for us.
Having attended a few of them myself, I can safely say that the social events planned by the EGSC have been amazing. However, the experience can further be improved. As I mentioned in the EGSC meeting as well, it&#039;d be better if trips such as SixFlags do not clash with any department orientation. I understand that orientation happens Monday to Friday and some department is bound to miss out, perhaps one possible solution could be to hold it before orientation week starts? OR if that&#039;s not a feasible option, have the event twice in the orientation week. Or have it on the weekend?

I served as Vice Presiden of the Upsilon Pi Epsilon Society of Computer Science at West Virginia Univesity. I dealt with issues within the society, social media, and leading tutoring sessions for undergraduate students. I also served as a board member in the WVU Computer Science and Electrical Engineering Student Advisory Council. My duty was to serve as a voice of the CS students and make concerns known and dealt with. I also organized social events and brought in guest lecturers, as well as worked to connect the CS/EE/CpE students to other engineering departments. Later at WVU, I served as a member of the Society of Women Engineers, where I worked with others to make the voices of not only women, but of other underrepresented groups in engineering heard.

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
As a new entrant into the university, I have already met several students who have expressed concerns. One of my visions is to help these students and create a better Columbia for everyone. I would also like to organize social events and foster a better relationship between students both within and out of their departments. Many students entering a difficult program keep to themselves, and fostering a great social environment could help them both mentally and physically. Finally, I would like to create an online forum where students can give input on things they would like to see happening around campus, to make Columbia a more exciting and student-driven university.

I was a member of Sigma Nu fraternity, and served as Marshal, which helped plan social events for members of the fraternity, as well as events between us and other greek organizations.  I was also a member of Eta Kappa Nu, the Electrical and Computer Engineering Honor Society, and served as treasurer to manage our (low) funds through the year.

I would love to be on the social committee at it is something I did at the undergraduate level.  I want to continue to help planning social events and trips for all the engineers to enjoy.  I loved a lot of the trips that were planned these past two weeks, and I think it would be amazing to volunteer to help plan these trips because I would get to experience absolutely everything that Columbia has to offer.  I think I would also be a good choice for the Interschool committee because my role in my fraternity was very similar in undergrad.  I think helping to plan events with and meet with others from different schools would be an amazing experience.  Mixers between schools would definitely be my priority, but events that could possibly merge job opportunities between schools could be a really awesome idea.

As an undergraduate at Allegheny College I was heavily involved in student government.  Over the course of my four years I served as the president of my class, the assistant director of student affairs, the director of student affairs and the president of the student body.  As president of the student body I led the development of Allegheny Student Government&#039;s first strategic plan.  The plan laid out a three year strategic vision for the organization.

For my efforts I was awarded the Cornerstone Award.  This award was given to thirteen seniors who left a legacy at Allegheny College through their social efforts.
<br><br>

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
My reason for applying to be a department representative is simple.  I am excited, eager, and enjoying my time here at Columbia University and I want to provide the same for anyone who is not.

Specifically, at Allegheny College I very much enjoyed working with the administrators on campus to solve student problems in the context of administrative constraints.  As such I would love to be a part of the Academic Affairs committee.

I see this committee as the entity that efficiently and transparently recognizes student concerns, conveys them accurately to administration, and develops a solution that brings about a better graduate experience for everyone.

As a two year executive member of the Academic Affairs committee equivalent at Allegheny, we also distributed an annual campus wide survey to students.  I am looking forward to hopefully adding my input to the ones developed here at Columbia.  Moreover, I feel I can contribute a fresh perspective as a new student and an open mind eager to absorb a new student council experience.

If not chosen as a member of the Academic Affairs committee I am more than happy to lend my hand on other committees as well.  To speak to them quickly I think it is important and beneficial to bring together the campus as a whole and also important to maximize the utility gained from a limited budget.  As such the Interschool and Budget committees are also two that I am interested in.

I was also president of the Society of Physics Students so I understand how to approach a committee from a department specific perspective as well.

Career Development
-I think we should have information sessions by students who have interviewed  before for certain companies so they can share their experiences and the DO&#039;s and DONT&#039;S and how to go about the preparation.
-Department wise blogs regarding internships and job placements and how to go about the process.

SOCIAL
-When we have our  happy hours probably we can couple it with fun activities or events..like for example have a bingo night or screen a movie.
-Maybe we can organize themed parties, or parties with a fun motives like &quot;Czar and Czarina&quot; (which is influenced by powerful Russian emperor)...here we can have 3 rounds where the contestants should display a strong and confident personality.At the end of the event the most popular and powerful personalities wins the title of Czar or Czarina.
-I consider myself a good event organizer as I have planned socials before and am well planned and organized and i am good at coming up with themed parties and how to set it up keep track of the invitations and other stuff.

Hey guys, so basically I am people person I mix easily and love meeting new people and making new friends/connections and most importantly I have a need to be involved and be a part of something. Since school I have always been at the middle of all student activity as I consider it fun and that&#039;s what kept me sane and going after all the studying. And of course being part of all those groups definitely made me a more interesting person in terms of all the experiences and leadership skills acquired on the journey. So here at Columbia I feel being a part of EGSC would be a great experience and I hope I could contribute to all the cool work EGSC is doing and its providing me a great opportunity for connecting with students across all disciplines of SEAS and I look forward to it.

- Graduate programs at Columbia University can be very intense considering the relatively short duration of most programs and the difficulty of academic life. Fostering friendships among students is extremely beneficial in the sense that it's good moral support, and strong networks from now can go a long way. 
- Fortunately, I have had great experiences working in various student organizations from high school to undergrad. I describe myself as approachable, reliable, and organized, and a great candidate for the EGSC committee. I love meeting, talking, and working with people. I believe my background in computer science and an international student who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin, and Japanese will really help including other international students in EGSC's events. Studying abroad can be extremely difficult for a lot of international students and it's not surprising that they refuse to stay out of the social clique with students form their home country. I believe my role in EGSC can really encourage international student's participation in various school events, and form strong relationships with students from other cultures.
