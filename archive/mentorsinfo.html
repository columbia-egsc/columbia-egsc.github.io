Andrea Morrell is a PhD student.
I'm excited to be a peer mentor because I enjoy sharing my experiences and helping others. Having gone through the same things, I think I can help mentees adjust to different aspects of graduate school life such as managing research and coursework. In my free time, I like to explore NYC with my friends as well as run and do yoga. I love being a graduate student in NYC and at Columbia and am excited to get to know other grad students and help them enjoy their time here as well

Q7: Tell us a little about yourself. (e.g. What motivates you to be a peer mentor? What do you think you can help with mentees? Or what do you like to do in free time? Simply anything you want to share with us.)
I have always been interested in helping people, especially those in my own program. I explore the city going to many restaurants and bars. Hang out with friends and my girlfriend as well on the weekends.

I am motivated to be a peer mentor because I believe community-building and mental health resources are not always appropriately emphasized in graduate school. Graduate students have already learned independence and self-reliance in college, and many have taken several years off from their studies to work full-time before matriculating. For these reasons, faculty and administrators may wrongly assume there is less need for mentorship and guidance throughout graduate education because the students are more mature. This translates into fewer resources overall for graduate students during a time of intense responsibility and educational rigor; therefore, initiatives like the Peer Mentoring Program are crucial to filling this void.

I'm a first year graduate student, studying M.S. in Management Science & Engineering. This is my second semester at Columbia and I will be graduating in December 2014. From day one, I had been having a lot of questions about pretty much everything, where to buy the books from, whether I should even buy them or not, what classes would best fit with my career goals, where to eat around school and so on. I did manage to find my "way" in the past few months but it was not that easy. I wished that I did have someone as a mentor to ask my questions to. Now that I am thankfully done with this phase, and I know how challenging it can be at times for incoming students, I would be very happy to serve as a mentor to new/younger students who came in this semester or may be coming any time in the future. I would love to share my experience and insight to guide them through their adaptation phase to Columbia and to graduate studies in general.

Q6: Topics you would like to discuss with mentees or other mentors.
Stress management in NYC/Columbia. Whatever else they wanna talk about.

Thought being a mentor would be useful. As I've either never had one or had ones that were not very helpful, anything more would be an improvement! Can help mentees with brainstorming. Free time spent working, scheming, exercising, cooking, planning a trip somewhere, starting books but not finishing them. Good job taking initiative to set up mentor program, it'll be helpful. Thanks, Ben

My name is Josue, a SEAS Masters student. I was a peer mentor as an undergrad. It has been extremely rewarding for me and I look forward to working with new students.

I was born and raised in the NYC area and currently an MS in the mechanical engineering department. I would gladly help anyone become accustomed to both NYC, Columbia, being a grad student, etc. I enjoy meeting new people and doing all kinds of things. In my free time I like to go to the movies, play guitar and drums, listen to music, go to museums and concerts as well as read.

I received an enormous amount of help and support from my seniors when I first arrived here, and I'd like to pass on the favor to new students. Being an international masters student, I can give specific advice related to the CS masters program, as well as general advice about campus activities and getting to know the city. In my spare time I enjoy playing the piano.

I have had alot of success navigating the academic world and would like to help others. I can help them prepare for their next steps (college, graduate school, jobs) through application preparation, essay/CV reviews, advice on how to network and communicate. In my free time, I enjoy watching/playing sports, going out to bars, lifting weights, playing video games.

Hi! Myself Sarthak, a grad student at Columbia University, specializing in Electronics. My major is in Circuits and System design at chip level, referred to as VLSI in technical jargon! In simple terms, whatever electronics we see around whether it be your computer, laptop or mobile, has a small chip inside it. And guess what! Whatever goes inside that chip is designed by me!! Besides being interested in product design specialization, my other interests include jogging, swimming, cooking, reading spiritual books, attending cultural fests and the most important one: making new friends and sharing new ideas with them! Are you excited about meeting me? Coz I am!!
