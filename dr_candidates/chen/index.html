                            <h3>Please describe any relevant past experience</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I took a leave of absence for 2 years due to mandatory military service in Korea. Military life requires high levels of responsibility and punctuality. I am therefore trained to be productive and efficient with my time. Teamwork and comradeship are also emphasized and I strive to be cooperative when working with others.

 Besides the recent military experiences, I also had several experiences with student organizations in college. At UC Berkeley, I was the President of Korean-American Scientists and Engineers in my Senior year. Before my president position, I was the Professional Development chair. It was a rigorous position, where I had to organize professional panel events and networking events.

 I was also the social chair at the professional Chemistry fraternity, Alpha Chi Sigma. I helped organize potluck events, movie nights, bowling and happy hours.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Department representatives are chosen to serve as student liaisons between the Council and their respective departments.

 Administrative committee is an area I have yet to try. I believe the administrative committee plays an important role when dealing with internal affairs. As the department representative for administrative committee, I want to make sure all meetings and activities are recorded. I think it is important to keep all paperworks and files up to date to make sure there is an ongoing archive that the department and students can refer to. I am punctual and organized, which is an important factor when taking minutes and records of meetings.

 Academic affairs is my second choice. If I were to work in this committee, I will make sure students have their opinions delivered to the proper authorities. After reading the constitution, I am aware that student surveys need to be conducted along with annual Town Hall meetings. I will make sure this happens at least with the Chemical Engineering department.

 Lastly, alumni affairs grabbed my attention because I always believed that networking is crucial in our modern society. I am actually very curious where graduates ended up and how they ended up where they are. My goal is to make sure we utilize them and learn from their success.

                            <h3>Any other relevant information you would like to share</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">My leave of absence for 2 years is a long time, but I believe it renders me as a more enthusiastic and passionate candidate for this position. I love being back in school! I love the environment and opportunities Columbia has to offer. Now that I am back for a good amount of time I want to be more active and participate in student affairs and committees.</p>
