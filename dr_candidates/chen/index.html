                            <h3>Please describe any relevant past experience</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Although it is not to my benefit, I will say that this is new for me.  However, I am eager to push my boundaries and discover new aspects of my personality by holding a position of responsibility. The most relevant experience I have had is to lead a team to organize an event in the cultural festival of my undergraduate institute. This included budgeting, advertising, acquiring participants from all over the country (India), inviting judges, looking after logistics etc. </p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Chemical Engineering has an intermediate strength in numbers compared to the rest of the engineering departments. However, regardless of its numbers, it should be afforded an equal percentage of the limelight within the academic as well as social circle. For academic affairs, it is essential to have a good network of communication, not only within the department but interdepartmental as well. This allows awareness of the technical electives and research opportunities outside one's own department but still within one's interest areas. For administrative department, I believe it is essential to relieve the burden on students of admin work, hence if they have a person who has set procedures for any kind of problems, it would be a great benefit. I would also like to help post these solutions to common issues online for wider perusal. For the other posts, I would try my best to complete the given duties and try to incorporate ideas which leads to a better and more structured organization of EGSC.

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Public Relations Officer and Class Representative of Korean Student Association (during undergraduate career)</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">My goal is to allow students from all departments to feel connected and as one with each other. Students would be encouraged and have additional opportunity to go outside their department and interact with students from other departments. Graduate school coursework is difficult and by promoting social events, I hope to relieve students' stress to a reasonable extent. During my undergraduate career, I served as a class representative and public relations officer of the Korean Student Association (KSA). The duties I had as a KSA member correlate very well with those of an EGSC Social Events Committee member as I had to plan and organize annual events. I promoted events both physically (hardcopy flyers) and digitally (social media platform) and supervised events with fellow officers.</p>
