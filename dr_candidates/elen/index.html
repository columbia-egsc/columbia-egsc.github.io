So, I know how to get maximum utility out of minimum resource. I can plan long term fund disbursement, this is what I have done before.  Advising or consulting the elements that will go to the media is also another arena of my expertise.  So, I believe I have all sorts of experience EGSC needs for smooth flow of this organization.</p>

                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I think it's important for the graduate students to have a social life apart from the academic life to beat stress and enjoy to the fullest. I'd love to initiate and organize events to network with peers and alumni to share experiences, perspectives and career tips. As an international student, I'd love to embrace the different cultures on campus and learn from them. The university has a lot of resources to offer and I can help channeling them effectively towards the students.</p>

                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Proper communication between the students and the university is a fundamental factor in academic life. My goal is to ensure this by properly conveying the issues and concerns of the students to the university and inform the student about the decisions and advises given by the university. I would take this opportunity to understand the interests and needs of  my fellow students and then organize events like career services, alumni meetings, social or cultural events, etc. I have prior experience in representing the students in my undergrad college and I was able to fulfill my responsibilities.  I am confident that I can do the same here. </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I was chairperson of student branch of IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering) in final(fourth) year of my undergrad. Under my tenure as a chairperson, I organized multiple events including 2 workshops, seminar, 3 technical events in technical festival of my undergrad college, IEEE day events and an industrial visit. Being a chairperson of the branch, I was the student in charge of all the events, plus event head (direct event handling) in technical paper presentation event, organized in the inter-school technical festival of my undergrad college. Apart from that, I was also Research Development Head (R&D Head, part of technical committee) of the same council in my third year of engineering, where I served as event head for workshops and technical events. Apart from my extensive work for IEEE student branch, I also worked as a volunteer in my first and second year of undergrad college for technical and cultural festivals. I was winner of 'best individual debater' in my third year of engineering, further underlying my public speaking and analytical skills.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">My vision for committee of my choice are as follows: -To collaborate with all the recognized student organizations and if possible try to conduct multiple join events in collaborations with them. -To help organized student bodies in increasing activity in terms of events and propose event ideas. -To make sure that the relations between student organizations are smooth and they are functioning properly. -To suggest more advertising mediums, so that council events can reach out to a large number of people. -Improve participation from students, so as to get more event ideas and eventually proposals from them. -Suggest celebration of various international events/festivals, so that the participation from international students can be increased.</p>
