                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Alumni play a very important role in academia.They can guide, they can motivate and they can drive the students presently in Columbia University to success. We can do this by effectively managing the alumni's of Columbia University.   We as a student should not only be focusing on honing out technical skills but also to start focusing on skill sets required for success in careers. I would really like if there are more career development workshops.   The roles I have chosen above closely aligns to the role I had played as a Placement Secretary in my undergraduate. The previous experience will certainly help me to effectively fulfill my duties.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Recently, I worked as the supervising engineer of a construction site back in my country Bangladesh that necessitated building of a house- budgeting, labor management, procurement, disturbance handling, and designing. Also, I acted as the class representative all along my high school, college, and university. As a class representative, my primary responsibility was to maintain liaison between the students and administration. Moreover, I served as an executive committee member of my university debating club. Apart from that, I am experienced in organizing many events- social, class, debating, and sports. I also have prior experience in mentoring junior students. Furthermore, I worked as a lecturer in a university for six months.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Apart from studies, I mostly worked as an administrator. I can carry out important administrative duties inside EGSC.  My recent job at a construction site required fund management in an efficient manner. I am experienced in making maximum utility out of minimum resource. This experience can be useful for budget committee inside EGSC. Advising or consulting the elements that will go to the media is also another area of my interest. Having a variety of experiences should present me as a competitive candidate for EGSC committee.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I think it's important for the graduate students to have a social life apart from the academic life to beat stress and enjoy to the fullest. I'd love to initiate and organize events to network with peers and alumni to share experiences, perspectives and career tips. As an international student, I'd love to embrace the different cultures on campus and learn from them. The university has a lot of resources to offer and I can help channeling them effectively towards the students.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Proper communication between the students and the university is a fundamental factor in academic life. My goal is to ensure this by properly conveying the issues and concerns of the students to the university and inform the student about the decisions and advises given by the university. I would take this opportunity to understand the interests and needs of  my fellow students and then organize events like career services, alumni meetings, social or cultural events, etc. I have prior experience in representing the students in my undergrad college and I was able to fulfill my responsibilities.  I am confident that I can do the same here. </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I was chairperson of student branch of IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineering) in final(fourth) year of my undergrad. Under my tenure as a chairperson, I organized multiple events including 2 workshops, seminar, 3 technical events in technical festival of my undergrad college, IEEE day events and an industrial visit. Being a chairperson of the branch, I was the student in charge of all the events, plus event head (direct event handling) in technical paper presentation event, organized in the inter-school technical festival of my undergrad college. Apart from that, I was also Research Development Head (R&D Head, part of technical committee) of the same council in my third year of engineering, where I served as event head for workshops and technical events. Apart from my extensive work for IEEE student branch, I also worked as a volunteer in my first and second year of undergrad college for technical and cultural festivals. I was winner of 'best individual debater' in my third year of engineering, further underlying my public speaking and analytical skills.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">My vision for committee of my choice are as follows: -To collaborate with all the recognized student organizations and if possible try to conduct multiple join events in collaborations with them. -To help organized student bodies in increasing activity in terms of events and propose event ideas. -To make sure that the relations between student organizations are smooth and they are functioning properly. -To suggest more advertising mediums, so that council events can reach out to a large number of people. -Improve participation from students, so as to get more event ideas and eventually proposals from them. -Suggest celebration of various international events/festivals, so that the participation from international students can be increased.</p>
