     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
For interschool committee, i hope to connect more with other schools and hold more events with other school. I can help to communicate with those student clubs at business school to cooperate some events together. This could help engineering students network with business school students. Also, for alumni affairs that i can work on to invite more guest speakers. I could also help promote the EGSC through digital media.

In my undergraduate institution, I was involved in a student organization that (i) weekly invited technology consulting companies, including but not limited to, big 4 accounting/consulting firms, Google, Microsoft, etc, (ii) held a career fair with 20+ companies, and (iii) held a networking event with working professionals who consisted mostly of alumni.
<br><br>

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
The goals and the vision of the career development committee, in my opinion, is to assist the students in gaining an internship, part-time or a full-time employment of their choices.

To contribute to such goals, firstly, I would like to align industry&#039;s requirements closely with the majors currently present in the graduate student&#039;s program. While widely available majors such as mechanical, electrical and chemical engineering are known to recruiters, majors, such as data science, are not yet widely recognized. 

Secondly, I want to actively engage working professionals with graduate students in the form of an information session that details the hiring process for firms so that students can customize their course selection and preparation to suit the needs of industries.

Lastly, by leveraging the department representatives and having a liaison with career services, the counsel can actively communicate with students in respective departments for career opportunities and more in-depth discussions in the form of an email or a meeting.
