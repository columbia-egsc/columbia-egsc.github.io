Undergraduate:
Served as the Principal Designer for the UC Berkeley Construction team where I was responsible for coordinating budget and schedule needs with the Project Managers while coming up with a creative solution.  


Professional:
Served on the Diversity Committee where my responsibilities included organizing the activities for the my company&#039;s &quot;Inclusion Week.&quot;  Activities included team bonding events and seminars by HR professionals.
Recruited by the Business Development team to participate in outreach through evening networking functions, where I had to interact with professionals from different industries who could potentially be our clients or partners.  
<br><br>

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
My goal (for any three of the selected committee) is to increase awareness among our engineering graduate student peers of the breadth of opportunities available.  Whether it is within our industries (alumni affairs), outside our industries (interschool), or within SEAS (social), by highlighting the diversity of our education and experiences, I think EGSC could continue to play a role in shaping a more diverse experience for the SEAS student body.

Career development: We clearly need to push ahead aggressively on recruitments as there is a perception that we are punching below our weight. Two suggested steps:

a. Alumni brand ambassadors: The IEOR department has 2500+ alumni occupying positions of influence in industry. Through our Alumni affairs council, we reach out to these alumni and use their guidance in shaping curriculum and keeping it up to date. Additionally we could leverage their positions to suitably position IEOR as an excellent talent pool.

b. Enhance inter-department coordination: Much more can be done to encourage the various departments to coordinate amongst themselves to maximize the opportunities for students. 

Academics: There should be greater ease in cross-registering for courses across the university especially the B-School. 

Alumni affairs: Strengthen and deepen existing relationships with Alumni. Co-ordinate with local chapters to engage alumni more effectively for University milestones, achievements etc.
Setting up of Alumni mentorship program with grad students for guidance on matters relating to academics, career development etc.

Last year, I served as a student ambassador at the Alumni association of my school. In this role, I organized and participated in debates with young alumni over the evolution of education at the school and issued tailored recommendations to the dean. I also organized a student/alumni mixer where students could meet young alumni informally around a glass of wine.
As an undergraduate, I also got involved in several student associations and sports club, both in leadership positions and workforce support.
<br><br>

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
If I sit on the Alumni Committee, I will strive to develop further the relations with young alumni. I would like to ensure that alumni from all engineering departments are represented during Alumni events so that all students may have meaningful interactions. I will also encourage connections with alumni through the organization of social and professional events. To do so, I will leverage my communication and organization skills to coordinate with the other groups in charge of alumni within SEAS and Columbia. I am convinced that together we can attract alumni from all ages and backgrounds to events that will foster exchange between generations.

If I sit on the Academic Affairs Committee, I would like to contribute to the reflection on course content and how this articulates with the job requirements that students will face after graduation. To do so, I would like to build on alumni feedback on the challenges they faced as fresh graduates. I will also dedicate my time and my negociation skills to improving student quality of life.

If I sit on the Career Development Committee, I will leverage our relations with alumni to target the key skills firms are looking for. In addition to our excellent academic background, I intend to provide every Columbia&#039;s graduate student with a valuable professional state of mind. 
<br><br>
      
     <h4 class="team-member-name">Any other information you would like to share</h4>
I intend to thoroughly attend and participate in debates, whichever committee I will serve. I served in similar groups in France and loved my experience there. I am now looking forward to discovering new issues and stakeholders at Columbia. I am ready to learn and I hope I can help in the advancement of the EGSC by sharing my ideas and personal experience. 
I also plan on communicating and giving feedback to IEOR students on discussions and decisions met at the EGSC so that everyone has a say in the ongoing debates and events.

One of my goals for my graduate study at Columbia University is to establish an after-class study/networking club to gather students from diverse academic background. Engineering department attracts students from various fields, therefore, it is likely that students major in finance have trouble in understanding complicated math principle; or students major in engineering are unfamiliar with economics theories. I believe everyone would benefit from this type of event since it could not only provide a stage to enhance social skills, but also encourage students to actually help and learn from each other. Moreover, we could invite our alumni to give speeches and share their experience/career advices to broaden students&#039; perspectives. 

To sum up, my goal is to bring more engineering students to get involve in this community, meet more people and learn more knowledge, and hopefully build a strong connection between themselves and EGSC so that years from now, our current students who will be experts in various fields would like to come back to EGSC to share experiences and encourage more students to pursue their dreams.

SICA is one of the largest and most influential student clubs in Peking University.   The Public Relations department is in charge of cooperations with our sponsors, our alumni and other student international communication associations nationwide. We also help organize lots of social events and international communication programs, such as SICA&#039;s 15 year anniversary. I lead a team of more than 30 core members. We meet twice a week, or more frequently when necessary. Not only does our department successfully organize and hold all kinds of activities, but we keep great relationships with each other.

So I believe I can help new students get adapted to their new school quickly. In addition, I am from China. SEAS has a great portion of Chinese students with whom I share the similar educational and cultural backgrounds. This enables efficient communication among us that will contribute to improvement of every aspect of the school.

At the Siam Cement Group, my side work position is a Treasurer of Value Revolution Team (Jan 2013 - May 2014)
My main tasks are:
- Organized creative activities to foster relationship among people in the department by reducing gaps between senior management level, middle management level, and operation level.
- Promoted the ideas of teamwork and fundamental ethics through a business outing.
- Estimated and performed budget control of the activities using historical data and current expenditure.

During my undergraduate program, I engaged in the following activities:
- Teaching Assistant and Group Leader, 5-day English camp
- Bangkok Flood Relief Volunteer, Rajavidhi Hospital
- Coordinator, 9th Industrial Engineering Sports Game

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
My vision for the committees is to really engage people into activities and get them to know each other better. As I see now, there are a few of those who are still shy and do not really want to come out from their comfort zone to make new friends and connections.
My idea of bringing them together is to come up with small group activities where the people get to know each other in a small group instead of a big crowd.
The committees themselves should be diverse and the people must be creative and positive. I think I can contribute by bringing new ideas on how to split up works and run the committees with joy.

I worked as a tutor and grader for the past three years with Professor Varodayan in the math department. I coordinated my own study schedule with the tentative grading schedule, and I always finished my work at least two days before the deadline. I tutored at least 20 students in my tutoring session, and I was able to explain problems patiently until students could understand. 

I also worked as a teaching assistant from June to August, 2012. I delivered Professors requirements on different assignments to students in a efficient and effective manner, and I compiled students&#039; exam grades in excel and made histograms for professor to visualize their performances.

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
My goal to be part of the committees is to make our Columbia family closer. Instead of interacting with merely our classmates on a daily basis, students should be able to meet, communicate and learn from others who are not from the same department or schools. As a representative of my own department, I would work with other representatives to make the most of our time in Columbia through social events, alumni mixers and career development. What I can offer is my communication skill, my patience and the positive energy to keep the ball rolling.

I was the captain of the table tennis club at my undergraduate university. I was responsible for contacting team members, promoting table tennis in college, and organizing matches and weekly socials. My captaincy experience may not be relevant to my first preference for committee, which is academic affairs. However, part of my job was to promote table tennis. I spent a lot of time on talking with fellow students and exchanging opinions, which involved communication skills that will be very useful.

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
I hope to help students in my program (MSFE) obtain the best academic experience at Columbia. I will act as a liaison between students and the engineering school such that students&#039; opinions or concerns will be fully reflected.

As an IEOR student there are times when I have felt that the entire engineering community isn&#039;t together and we haven&#039;t had enough activities that bring us together. Some of the events have been fun but I feel a little change can go a long way in bringing the community together.

I have rich experiences of student activities&#039; organization and management. I used to be the president of sports department in Software Insititute, Nanjing University, vice president of Alumni Development Association of Nanjing University(NJUADA) and vice president of &quot;OPEN&quot; Open Source Software Enthusiast Association.

What I want to emphasize is the experience in NJUADA, in which I successfully organized a program to promote connection between alumni and undergraduate students at Nanjing University. In such program we successfully developed collaboration relationships with professional alumni ,created career opportunities for students to interact with Fortune 500 companies‰Ûª alumni and recruiters and helped students better prepare for career development, involve in practical activities and find internship opportunities.

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
Firstly, primarily based on the works I have done in my undergraduate time, I strongly believe that I can make better contribution to the organization and management of alumni affairs, strengthen existing links and establish new links between on-campus and off-campus Columbia Alumni.

Secondly, I clearly know how to maximize the power of existing alumni network to promote better career opportunities and services for on-campus student and try to expand the existing career network of Columbia.

Finally, to be honest, as a fresh graduate student in Columbia, I&#039;m exploring the strong provided infrastructure of  Columbia and will try my best to make it better in EGSC.

In the Social Committee, I will try my best to come up with interesting ideas, and find the most appropriate and exciting activities for graduate students to join. What&#039;s more, I&#039;m a Korean-Chinese, so I&#039;m familiar with both cultures and languages, so it will be easier for me to socializing with more people. Most importantly, I&#039;m new here which makes me more eager to make more friends and get to know this place than anybody. And I&#039;m very aware that I should not only play hard in the EGSC but also work harder. Hopefully, I can join the big group.

In my vision the Alumni Affairs Committee should be a platform that serves not only students but also alumni. Specifically, the Alumni Affairs Committee should become an &quot;interface&quot; where alumni can access university resources which include, but not limited to,  potential employee resource, communication with professors, latest research results, and opportunity to network with other alumni. I will contribute to this goal by assisting the Council to provide up-to-date and relevant information to alumni, and organizing events to foster the communication between alumni and professor/students.

For the career development, I want to hold more section that invite alumni to share some experience. These section should be more targeted and this can let each one takes what he needs. Also, some peer discussion may be held for case study and mock interview. It&#039;s true that the current career service is quite outstanding, we should try our best to make students set clear objectives
