                            <h3>Please describe any relevant past experience</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Ambassador of Mathematical & Physical Science at UC Davis:   During my senior year at UC Davis, I was recommended by my department to be an ambassador of Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS).  It is a year long position and we focused on advising and outreach.  Being an AMPS, I advised students in need and promoted MPS majors with different events through social media and other marketing tools.  As a committee chair, our team worked on a year-long project to create an alumni video that let the alumni to share their during/post-college experience to current students.  In addition, we also hosted a chemistry career fair and thus enhance the MPS society.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Career Committee:  Since most of master students are required to graduate within 1 and an half years, students sometime arenâ€™t well-prepared to launch a career after graduation.  I would like to help student to prepare their career profile at the earliest stage and guide them through their career path.    Social Committee:  As networking is one of the key aspects of jobs hunting, I want to join the social committee to help to expand the networking for engineering graduate students.  In addition, I would like to promote social events specifically for each department so that students can interact directly with people within their fields.  Alumni Committee:  Alumni is also an important resource for current students.  Since alumni have more experience within their fields, current student can be benefit by interacting with alumni.  I would like to help current students to build the connection between alumni, which can potentially guide them in their future career paths.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">With science background, I have worked in a securities company and a venture capital company. So I know how to make students who have science and engineering background involve into financial career. Also, I was a member of a student union in the College of William and Mary, planning and serving different events for students and scholars.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I would like to contact alumni and ask for their help and offer students in Engineering school more opportunities such as career events & talks, alumni connections, and job opportunities. For career development, I would like to use my working experience to guide students and give talks and discussions periodically for their future career. Also, I know a number of alumni who graduated from Columbia University and have positions in different areas such as venture capital securities, banking, IT, consulting, and industries.</p>
