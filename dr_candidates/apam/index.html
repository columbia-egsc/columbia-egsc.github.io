                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Ambassador of Mathematical & Physical Science at UC Davis:   During my senior year at UC Davis, I was recommended by my department to be an ambassador of Mathematical & Physical Sciences (MPS).  It is a year long position and we focused on advising and outreach.  Being an AMPS, I advised students in need and promoted MPS majors with different events through social media and other marketing tools.  As a committee chair, our team worked on a year-long project to create an alumni video that let the alumni to share their during/post-college experience to current students.  In addition, we also hosted a chemistry career fair and thus enhance the MPS society.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Career Committee:  Since most of master students are required to graduate within 1 and an half years, students sometime aren’t well-prepared to launch a career after graduation.  I would like to help student to prepare their career profile at the earliest stage and guide them through their career path.

 Social Committee:  As networking is one of the key aspects of jobs hunting, I want to join the social committee to help to expand the networking for engineering graduate students.  In addition, I would like to promote social events specifically for each department so that students can interact directly with people within their fields.

 Alumni Committee:  Alumni is also an important resource for current students.  Since alumni have more experience within their fields, current student can be benefit by interacting with alumni.  I would like to help current students to build the connection between alumni, which can potentially guide them in their future career paths.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I was the chair of a department at student union in my undergraduate. I have a good leadership, and I also connect well with classmates and professors. I am confident that I can finish the work given to me in time and help with projects.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I would like to work on building stronger connection between alumni and engineering students. Especially for people who is seeking for jobs, alumni can give them great help. Alumni are able to provide a real picture of industry and help students build networking. I would be very happy to help build a stronger and closer platform for alumni going back to Columbia and interact with students.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I have joined in Student Union when I was an undergraduate in Wuhan University, and I am quite clear how it works and how to communicate with teammates. What's more, I was the Vice Minister of New Life Home which is a volunteer organization in Wuhan University. Leading teams and train teams are quite familiar with me</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">One of my goals is to communicate with other graduates in our SEAS and learn something new from them. The sceond goal is serving all graduates. I do not want to change or lead them, just make their study and networking easier to them. The third goals is to improve my communication skills and other relative abilities from events I participate in.
 I am an international student and I know how to communicate with other international students easily. Also, I believe I am good at talking with other strangers and hardworking enough to complete tasks.</p>
                            <h3>Any other relevant information you would like to share</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I really value this opportunity to join in EGSC because I miss the first opportunity last year. I will do my best.</p>
