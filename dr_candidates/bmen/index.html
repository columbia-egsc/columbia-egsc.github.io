                            <h3>Please describe any relevant past experience</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I was associated with Jacobs Engineering India Pvt. Ltd. (Mumbai) as a Design Engineer in the Piping Department with a total experience of 20 months. In these twenty months, I created the 3D models of two petrochemical plants, one for the training project and another for the client in setting up their plant. The models created were well appreciated by the Manager, immediate supervisors and my team. I also took a pro-active stance to keep a track of the delivery of the work as per schedule. Apart from the projects, I was also highly inspired by the work of the BeyondZero Committee and hence joined the group- a highly enthusiatic team focused on increasing the awareness to ensure safety in the workspace, on-site locations during construction of the plant and also to take it beyond the organisation to our personal lives. I was responsible in organising floor talks every month and also other networking sessions. The concept of Safety also encouraged me to take up the responsibility of a First Aider. To be able to work as a team and coordinate various activities through effective time management and communication, alongside my project work, is one of biggest strengths. It gives me immense pleasure to have worked with an active team of both young and experienced Jacobians. I have also been a part of the Jacobs Future Network, a network of young professionals working towards building and enhancing the relationship among the employers. As a part of BeyondZero collaborating with JFN, I was one of the organisers of the event celebrating the World Anti Tobacco Day to promote a more willing mindset to quit the dangerous habit.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">"As an incoming MS student in BMEN, I have already been a part of a couple of events hosted by the EGSC team. I personally find these events a gateway to another world away from the tight academic schedule. I want to be a part of the organising team of such events to be a contributing factor in fostering a more interactive diverse student community in the university.
I also would like to create more face to face interaction between the aspirants in the field of Biomedical Engineering and the Columbia Alumni, who are not afraid to create their own path of interest and passion, no matter how hard it is. I strongly believe that to get to know more about the the prospects of various options in this field at the student level, gives more insights and helps us align and prepare ourselves to be a part of the ever competetive real world. For me to be able to receive such events from the current EGSC members is very exciting and keeps on watchful of any such upcoming events. I would want to be a part of the team to organise such events which are greatly informative."</p>

I started being involved in EGSC at the end of last semester and really enjoyed it. I would love to continue being involved!</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">My name is Angela Singh, and I’m currently a first-year master’s student in biomedical engineering. As an undergraduate, I served as President of my resident hall council, where I both managed a budget for the year and developed and put into motion monthly events to bring the community of more than 350 people together. Along with promoting the sense of community among the student population, I advocated for the needs of the residents by liaising with university administrators who directly impacted the residential experience. Although I’m just a first year in in the BME department, I’ve made efforts to listen to the department student body and try to relay concerns to the GraBME student council. Because of this, I’m currently the master's representative for GraBME, which conveys the interests of the MS students to GraBME, so that events could be catered specifically for them (i.e. professional/career related events, such as meet-and-greets with alumni). As an undergraduate from Columbia University, I’ve been in tune with the events on campus right from my first day of freshman year, and even demonstrated an interest right from the beginning regarding the graduate student unionization that took place last semester, as I wanted to make sure that everyone’s voice would be heard regarding this crucial issue. I hope that my experiences, both past and present, make me an ideal candidate for a Department Representative for Biomedical Engineering, and I hope to keep helping out my fellow engineering students in any way possible.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I understand that as a department representative, I will attend the department meetings regularly (which I already do as the MS representative for GraBME) and help convey the needs of the graduate students to the appropriate individuals on the council. As part of the Academic Affairs Committee, I’d want to see more connections with the administration in order to address the student concerns. To ensure this, I’d help with fostering connections with the administration and raising student concerns with the proper authorities. As part of the Administrative Committee, I’d help to ensure that events, issues, and resolutions discussed in EGSC were conveyed to the BME department in a timely manner, and that students would be kept informed of all things happening by advertising about the council events through available channels, such as social medial and listservs. Finally, as part of the Budget Committee, I’d put my past experience of managing a set budget to use and ensure that all proposals submitted to the Council were reasonable in ensuring that costs were enough to allow for events to happen, but not too extravagant either.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Goals and Vision

 On the academic front, I would advocate for more academic flexibility and openness between departments. There should be fewer course/facility restrictions imposed on students.

 Whereas on the social front, I would push for more interschool events to help build a stronger community within the school of engineering. In addition, would want to help organize events that help incoming graduate students comfortably assimilate into the Columbia engineering community.</p>
