                            <p style="text-align: justify;">During my undergraduate program I've been the Vice President of a club named "Invincible Leaders League" whose focus was to help students find their inner potential so that they can lead and represent themselves. I have also been the lead member of the fund raising committee in a NGO named "Together in Development and Education" whose aim was to collect funds monthly in order to carry out various NGO activities. I have also been the Placement Co-ordinator during my final undergraduate year where my role was to communicate with various MNC's in India and bring them for the on campus placement.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">My goal for the budget committee would be to clearly communicate with all other departments like planning and discuss with them regarding the allotment of funds and yes end the fiscal year with a positive balance and some reserve. Being a part of the inter-school committee, we could organise some leadership events where we bring in professionals to speak about their experiences.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">During my tenure as the Vice President of the Invincible Leaders League Club, we had organised events like TEDxNirmaUniversity for two consecutive years in 2016 and 2017.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I was an administrative member in the system design engineering department during my undergrad and hosted a couple of workshops and organized meetings in the department.

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">By being a minority as Japanese in the school, I have met and built great friendships with so many people from other countries but also had a tough time especially at the beginning of the program. The events organized by EGSC and GSA helped me a lot to get to know people from other departments and to explore many options in my academic/professional career. I would like to be in a part of administrative positions and lead students to experience more diverse and a supportive environment by sharing my experience.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I am currently a 2nd year Ph.D. student and started my master's program at Columbia back in 2015. After the master's program, I worked for a while as a structural engineer and decided to come back to Columbia for the current research project. I have been working on the optimization of infrastructures in Manhattan considering hurricane and climate change.</p>

I want to contribute my part by actively staying connected with the various alumni organizations for the EGSC which would have good opportunities for all students. For the social committee, I would contribute by volunteering at the social events that take place and input any ideas that my classmates and I come up with. For the budget committee, I would help with the budget proposals from student organizations. I remember and know how important these documents are for helping an organization get more support and attendance. </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;"> I was a member and then the vice president of department of literature and art in Student Union in undergraduate school. Our department organized the largest Welcome Party for freshman student in our school every year. As a participant and leader, I needed to consider the programming of the show, stage arrangement, coordination of arrangement of various departments, etc. The two Welcome Party I participated in were quiet successful and the latter one was called the most successful Party in recent year.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I hope that the students can not only focus on their school work but also willing to taking part in some social activities which are attractive and innovative designed by us making them enjoying their Columbia life. I will apply my experience of organizing the successful events in the committees to plan and organize better and more innovative social events in our school.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I have been deeply involved in student organizations throughout my undergraduate life. I along with a few batch mates founded the Civil Engineering Student Association (CESA) at my university. This gave a platform for to students to address their issues and conduct events outside the classroom within the department. I worked with student from various years to improve their student life and address their problems. I was also selected the Department Head for Sports which enabled me to improve the sports culture in the department. Furthermore I was involved in organizing committees in different leadership positions of various technical, cultural , entrepreneurial and sports events at my university. I want to continue use my capabilities to help improve the student life at Columbia University.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">"Interschool Committee: The core value of Columbia University is about diversity and collaboration. I want to work on that and help SEAS student work with different schools across the university to help. This would include organizing inter-school events in fun-filled environment.
                            Alumni & Career Chairs: Columbia alumnus are spread around the world and are great pioneers in their respective industries and students would learn a lot from their experiences. This would include talks by famous alumnus throughout the semester and networking events across the year
                            Budget Committee: Finance is the heart of every student organization. Getting the appropriate budget needs to be decided by their importance of their activities to the university's goals.  
                            Having interacted with students from various majors throughout my undergraduate life has given me different people's perspective and help them with their problems. Having been closely associated with my high school's alumni association, I have experience in organizing alumni events. Having worked with student organization has given me knowledge of their financial needs and how to prioritize them"</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">The Alumni Chair mentioned that he would like to improve the quality of alumni panel in the coming academic year by organizing alumni Talks and Dinners. I am interested in those ideas and would like to join in the committee. Based on my academic experience on journalism (my double major), I would like to create more interactive way to help student to be more involved in alumni panels, and at the same time, facilitate our brilliant alumni to share their views more efficiently. I agree that with higher frequency but fewer attendees in each panel, everyone will be more satisfied about this beneficial events.</p>
