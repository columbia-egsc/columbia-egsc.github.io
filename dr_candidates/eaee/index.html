                            <h3>Please describe any relevant past experience</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I have had various leadership and representation experiences throughout my undergraduate education. I was elected for the position of Campus Student Ambassador for 2 years, where I had the responsibility to raise the voice of over 1000 undergraduate students on multiple topics. In the journey I also worked for NGO communities around my city- Women Voices Wing and EduForAll.  I believe that I am a good fit for this position given my years of interest and experience in leadership activities, propensity and updated knowledge on issues of global importance-energy & environment, cross-cultural relations through multiple international conference participations and my strength to produce best result out of any given task within the stipulated timeline.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">EGSC is a diverse and active student body, which is marketing the brand name of SEAS around Columbia University. EAEE is surely a small department under SEAS but its representation is crucial in order to create an ideal student body. Through my participation as a departmental representative, my primary goal would be to market this department's unique and cross-cutting achievements. EAEE graduates seek and gain knowledge of multilayered global concerned issues, but it is unfortunate that still CCE as well as SEAS does not have a career-chair representative for this department. It is imperative to establish the brand of EAEE as soon as possible, and support the career dreams of graduate students.</p>

                            <h3>Please describe any relevant past experience</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">During my undergrad I had organised and taken part in many student committees and organisations. The major part of my work was organizing literary activities for various college events. The organization of these events dealt with development of the concept, marketing and getting funds for these events. I believe that this experience will come in handy for future endeavors.   </p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I believe, as a graduate student, along with a proper education we should also look out for career development and orientation. The Career Development Committee is my first choice as a lot of students need vital counsel in this regard. My vision would be to bring more tools to students to aid them in this endeavor which would require logistics and manpower which I believe I can provide. My vision for the Alumni Affairs committee would be to enhance further dialogue between students and alumni. This would be achieved by various new initiatives. The goal for the Budget committee would be to increase funding for EGSC events. This would be done by new initiatives including clever use of advertising and using the students themselves. </p>
