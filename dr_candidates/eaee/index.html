                            <p style="text-align: justify;">During my undergrad I had organised and taken part in many student committees and organisations. The major part of my work was organizing literary activities for various college events. The organization of these events dealt with development of the concept, marketing and getting funds for these events. I believe that this experience will come in handy for future endeavors.   </p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I believe, as a graduate student, along with a proper education we should also look out for career development and orientation. The Career Development Committee is my first choice as a lot of students need vital counsel in this regard. My vision would be to bring more tools to students to aid them in this endeavor which would require logistics and manpower which I believe I can provide. My vision for the Alumni Affairs committee would be to enhance further dialogue between students and alumni. This would be achieved by various new initiatives. The goal for the Budget committee would be to increase funding for EGSC events. This would be done by new initiatives including clever use of advertising and using the students themselves. </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I have had various leadership and representation experiences throughout my undergraduate education. I was elected for the position of Campus Student Ambassador for 2 years, where I had the responsibility to raise the voice of over 1000 undergraduate students on multiple topics. In the journey I also worked for NGO communities around my city- Women Voices Wing and EduForAll.
 I believe that I am a good fit for this position given my years of interest and experience in leadership activities, propensity and updated knowledge on issues of global importance-energy & environment, cross-cultural relations through multiple international conference participations and my strength to produce best result out of any given task within the stipulated timeline.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">EGSC is a diverse and active student body, which is marketing the brand name of SEAS around Columbia University. EAEE is surely a small department under SEAS but its representation is crucial in order to create an ideal student body. Through my participation as a departmental representative, my primary goal would be to market this department's unique and cross-cutting achievements. EAEE graduates seek and gain knowledge of multilayered global concerned issues, but it is unfortunate that still CCE as well as SEAS does not have a career-chair representative for this department. It is imperative to establish the brand of EAEE as soon as possible, and support the career dreams of graduate students.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I would like to help to organize more career events and social events for engineering students, since networking is the foundation of a successful career. I want to join the social committee to help to expand the networking for engineering students. Additionally, I want to organize social events with selected departments so that students can interact directly with people within different fields.</p>

 CU Energy Symposium Marketing and Communications Team - manage listserv of 2000+ emails, help create website in Wix, help edit newsletters in MailChimp

 At UPenn (my undergrad):
 Penn Queer & Asian - Communications Chair and Senior Board Member, mentored students and created/hosted social events
 Penn Government & Politics Association - worked on Engaging Women in Politics Committee
 Polybian Society - mentorship and informal debate
 Penn Political Union - represented and gathered support for my caucus as progressive caucus whip</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Career Development and Alumni networking are definitely things that important as masters and PhD students looking for employment post-graduation. I'm hoping to be able to contribute to helping my fellow students find career prospects as well as develop my own networking and outreach skills in a formal environment. Career Development would involve planning workshops and company talks for interested students. Alumni Affairs would involve working with invited alumni back to talk and give advice to students. I also applied for the social committee because I'm more experienced in managing social events from my time at Penn Queer & Asian, but I'd prefer trying my hand at the other two committees if there is space on those instead.</p>

                            <h3>Please describe any relevant past experience</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout high school and college, I have had numerous positions in my extracurricular activities that invoked leadership and communication skills, all of which are essential to being a representative on the Engineering Graduate Student Council.

 At Stuyvesant High School in NY, I served as vice president of the environmental club during which I was in charge of communicating between members of the club and the board in addition to discussing the needs of the club to academic supervisors. Throughout college, I have also worked in various organizations that have required skillful communication. For example, I was a member of Alternative Breaks, an organization in which students go on service trips for various social issues. As a member of a group that targeted domestic violence, my teammates and I oversaw a Facebook campaign run by a domestic peace organization in Chicago that informed its audience about domestic violence and where they can get help. We also ran a campaign at our college at New York University sharing with students the resources available to them on how to inform themselves about domestic violence and who can help. This service experience in particular was an excellent way to learn about hosting informative events that are also engaging enough for peers to want to participate.

 I have also worked as a peer health educator, teaching comprehensive curriculums on sexual health in various high schools that do not have health education. This, in addition to various tutoring experiences, taught me how to manage a large group of people and present lessons in an engaging way. I believe my teaching experiences have helped me develop public speaking skills as well as effective communication not only online but in person with professionals or students.

 As a representative, I will have a duty to relay the concerns and interests of members in my department to the council, representatives of other schools, administrators and faculty. Given my experience in various organizations, I am confident in my ability to effectively and professionally carry out each task as a representative and make sure my peers get the most out of their time at Columbia University.
 </p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the main reasons I want to be a student council representative for the environmental engineering department is because I have many ideas I want to bring forth to the council.

 For example, for the career development committee I think there needs to be a more active role of alumni or upperclassmen in the degree programs. The best resource these students can provide is advice and connections with outside organization. Environmental engineering in particular is lacking in a strong alumni network. This was particularly evident in last year’s alumni night which did not have a very good turnout. I think if we set up a drive or a listserv in which upperclassmen and alumni list organizations they have worked with and commit to being a valuable resource to their peers and mentees, we can build a stronger network. This network has to come from active membership and participation. This compilation of connections and past organizations can allow current students to see where they can fit themselves into for post-graduation and summer plans.

 As part of the committee on social affairs, I think a great idea would be to set up NYC tour guides with groups of students. This is similar to a program we had at NYU in which a student led a tour around a specific area of NYC. These trips have been very informative even for a native New Yorker like myself. These events were also great opportunities for bonding with peers while we explored. I think the current social events have thus far been great, but it would be good to see more casual events occur more often than one or two big and pricey events.

 Finally, as a representative on the academic affairs committee, I am committed to listening to my peers and their academic concerns. Graduate students in particular are either employees of the university or pay a lot of money to get their degree. It is the direct responsibility of students to be active in voicing their expectations from a world class institution and I want to help them be heard.

 As discussed above, I have many goals and ideas in mind that I look forward to discussing with fellow EGSC members. I want to help my peers to get through Columbia knowing they have someone who can speak for their interests and ideas. Finally, my enthusiasm for the many things the council can accomplish will be my strongest contribution.</p>

                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I am very interested in the interschool committee since I know how important communication between departments or schools is to enhance our academic experience. I would be very interested in organizing events where we could get to know more about what our peers in other departments or schools are working on.

 I think I could contribute to the Career Development committee since I've had experience working in industry and also in the academic track. I did my masters here at Columbia in the Chemical Engineering Department, then took a year off to work in industry and then decided to come back to school so I think I can give a good perspective on issues relating to choosing career paths.

 Finally, I would also be interested in the social committee. I think there should be more integration events. As a member of a minority group (mexican woman engineer) I feel that the social events have helped me to bond with other students with similar backgrounds, share experiences and tips and create a sense of belonging. I would like to be able to be more involved and provide perspective on what should be interesting to include in social events to make them more meaningful experiences to everybody.</p>
