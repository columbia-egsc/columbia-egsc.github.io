I completed my undergraduate at Drexel University where I majored in Biomedical Engineering. I’m planning on running as an department representative since during my undergraduate I have served similar roles in the organizations I was involved. I served as an academic and social chair in AOE, a professional and social sorority, chapter that I founded as an alpha member at Drexel University. I planned events with other greek and professional organizations on campus and also faculty talks. I was also a student leader and student coordinator for the REACH Center at Drexel, a pilot program to bring cardiovascular health awareness into the community. My role at the reach center was to coordinate all the individual projects while I also run my own project. My project was to provide free CPR training for all Drexel students in collaboration with the Department of Emergency Medicine at Drexel.","Academic Affairs","Social","Digital Media","As a department representative I will attend department meetings regularly and communicate the needs of the graduate students to the Division/Department or with the Faculty Board representatives, as appropriate. In addition, I will bring up student issues in these meeting and share feedback with students about relevant discussions held at the Council meetings.   As part of the academic affair committee, I can contribute in fostering the connections with the administration and raise student concerns to the appropriate authorities. I can recruit associate members to join comities and assist and participate in council events and functions. In addition, I can assist in the planning of the annual Town Hall meeting and plan and conduct the annual student survey.  My vision in this committee would be to partner with academic units to provide international and underrepresented minority support in the efficiency of their graduate studies. To provide opportunities through funding to support student to enhance and further their education. In addition, I think it is really important to share and provide information within the graduate education community and raise student concerns to the proper authorities.   As part of the social events committee, my contribution will be in planning and organizing one time or reoccurring events that will bring the graduate students together. In addition, I plan on organizing and volunteering in EGSC happy hours and advertise these events through flyers and social media. I think that these social events are really important in fostering communication between students and alumni and also students and faculty members.   As part of the career development committee I plan on creating/updating a database that keeps all the contact information of the graduating engineering alumni. I plan on organizing and planning events with the Alumni Association and career services such as resume developing and Tech talks that will promote the professional development of the students. In addition, I believe that regular communication between SEAS office and CEAA, CEYA and the Center for Career Education is crucial in order to make the planning of these events more including and better advertised.","I'd like to give a more detailed information on what I have done to give back to the community during my undergraduate studies.  Community Service: The REACH center   I am a leader and the coordinator for the REACH center, a project that has started in February 2014. REACH Center is a pilot program established by Dr. Alisa Clyne to bring cardiovascular health awareness into the community. My role at the REACH center is to launch and establish the outreach aspect of the program. As a student leader, I had the opportunity to take my passion for giving back to the community, my skills, knowledge, and innovative thinking to a higher level. Here, I closely worked with other student leaders along with Dr. Clyne to establish a High School Student Heart Health Program - a newly developed outreach program to increase cardiovascular health awareness in local high school students. I played an important role in leading a team of 12 passionate student volunteers from diverse backgrounds, establishing connections with various schools and community organizations, as well as instituting the program to be implemented.   Since April 2015, I am in charge of leading and coordinating all other student leaders and their respective projects. There are two main projects that are being implemented: the Laughter Yoga and the CPR training. The Laughter Yoga is a weekly program of laughter yoga sessions for Drexel students. It uses laughter yoga techniques to reduce stress, strengthen the immune system and improve heart health. The CPR training project is being implemented to provide free CPR training for Drexel students. Since cardiac arrest in one of leading causes of death in the Unites States, performing CPR in time can save lives. We are promoting the benefits of being CPR trained and offering training for free by collaborating with the Department of Emergency Medicine at Drexel University.   As I continue to face roadblocks in successfully implementing the program, this experience has given me a deeper insight into understanding what it takes to make an effective contribution to the community. Through this experience, I uncovered the lack of awareness in our community for different kinds of medical issues. Moreover, it has allowed me to explore my own strengths as a leader and as an individual working in a team.  Volunteering Experience  I volunteered at Cooper Hospital for over a year from September 2014 to September 2015. Cooper Hospital is located in Camden, NJ, one of the cities with the highest rate of crime in the US. I chose to be part of the Cooper Emergency Department Academic Associate Program because I wanted to assist others in need and demonstrate my commitment and interest in the undeserved. During this program, I enrolled patients present in the Emergency Department in several studies, obtained informed consent and assisted them in completing a questionnaire and additional documentation. This experience gave me a whole new prospective on how emergency departments function and what can be done to better the system. I was in continuous contact with the doctors, attendings, nurses, techs and various patients, some of which were in pain, unable to talk or could not speak English.  My main role was to serve as an academic associate and enroll patients in several studies. At first, since I had access to the hospital database, I screened all the patients eligible for the study and then I consulted with their attendings whether I could go and speak to them. I was part of several studies that included various age groups. One study was about the risks and knowledge of pediatric poisoning, which involved patients from the ages of 2 to 10 years old. For this study I interacted with the child's parent and asked them to fill a short survey. Another study was on the use of tablets for patients above 65 years old. In this study, I directly talked to the patients, who had to use a tablet. At first I had to explain them what the study was about and ask them if they agreed to be part of it. As easy as this may sound, it was often a struggle to make a point about the study and it's consequences on the patient itself. In addition, if I had free time, I tried to convince patients to quit smoking, if they expressed interest.   I decided to volunteer because I wanted to make a change and give back to the community. I realize that my contribution is small, but I love helping others in any way I can. Working with patients can be difficult sometimes, but it is crucial to understand what they are going through and be patient. Most importantly, I learned that the quality of care we provide to them is what matters the most and what can really make an impact on the community.","2018","https://www.jotform.com/uploads/nikul@egsc.seas.columbia.edu/42444463566964/350657009771691812/13244074_10208143763625584_7284425594101543005_o.jpg"

Both current students and alumni can benefit from greater interaction through alumni meets, networking socials, organized talks, one-on-one interactions, etc. A more cohesive alumni network will help current students find mentors to guide them and help the alumni to find students for prospective jobs, internship positions; provide a way for them to continue to benefit from association with their alma mater as well as allow them to contribute to the growth of Columbia. I can contribute as I have previous experience in managing Alumni affairs for my undergraduate institution where I led a team of 40+ students to improve and build the alumni network  through organized lectures/talks, multiple alumni meets and alumni visits. Also as part of the Data Science Institute, I would like to invite our department alumni to be more strongly connected not just with DSI but with Columbia as a whole as data science is an upcoming field with a lot of interdisciplinary relevance.  Academic Affairs: As part of the Academic Affairs Committee and as a department representative, I wish to understand how academic administration is managed so that problems faced by students pertaining to curriculum, examinations, grading, etc, can be rightly addressed. There are often several suggestions and feedback that peers and seniors have relating to academic affairs, which could make a big difference in the academic life of students as a whole if they can go through the proper channels and be addressed correctly in time. I would like to bring forward feedback from my peers and be actively involved with change implementation as part of the committee.   Career Development: As part of the Career Development committee, I wish to act as a link between my department and EGSC so that there can be mutual benefit from collaboration. I would like to bring to the table both the problems DSI faces and the solutions we have come up with in terms of career development. Despite lots of provisions, I feel that there should be more field-specific career development opportunities for students and that there should be a mechanism so that interested students are able to take advantage of all opportunities on campus that may interest them, even if they are not aligned with a particular department or group. More collaboration amongst departments will help significantly in the students' career development.","","Dec 2017","https://www.jotform.com/uploads/nikul@egsc.seas.columbia.edu/42444463566964/350756525651988330/amla%20%281%29.jpg"

"2016-09-23 10:16:04","Michael","Sutton","mms2306@columbia.edu","mms2306","Biomedical Engineering","I have served on councils for student groups in both high school and college. Some of my most recent involvement includes being the financial chair for my undergraduate chapter of the National Society of Black Engineers, an organization committed to increasing the number of culturally responsible Black Engineers who excel academically, succeed professionally and positively impact the community. In addition, I served as Vice President of my residential house council, where I helped organize a number of events for about 100 students on a bi-weekly basis and served as a liaison between students and housing department administration. I am also currently running for the position of Secretary of GraBME for the upcoming academic year.  Although I am a new student to this campus, I have already made a number of efforts to engrain myself in the atmosphere of Columbia University and the concerns of its student body. I have demonstrated a deep interest in events that will affect this campus, such as the discussion of graduate students forming a union. I have also taken the initiative in orchestrating a number of events for my fellow BME graduate students to enhance their academic opportunities (e.g. talking with EHS staff to have a C14 certification class for qualified first years), as well as to contribute to an enjoyable social climate around the department (e.g. forming a fantasy football league among BME graduate students).  I think my past experience and demonstrated initiative make me an excellent candidate to be a Department Representative for Biomedical Engineering this year, and I appreciate having the opportunity to continue to serve my fellow engineering students in a broader capacity.","Academic Affairs","Interschool","Budget","For the Academic Affairs Committee, I hope to see a greater degree of transparency from the administration and the things that most affect the student body. I understand that one of the tasks of this committee is raising student concerns to the proper authorities, and I think I can contribute in this regard, because I have a true desire to seek out students and learn what their concerns are. I think that a vast number of students have things that they would like to see changed, or perhaps better implemented, but there isn't always the time or energy for them to individually find the correct people to talk to. I would like to help streamline this process and make it easier for their concerns to be heard when they come up. I think this will add to the actions we are able to take after receiving the student survey, particularly for students who, for whatever reason, might choose not to fill it out or wanted more of a face to face conversation about their concerns.  One of the selling points for me as a prospective graduate student at Columbia was the opportunity for interdisciplinary research, and I believe that has the capacity to extend beyond the classroom. I think maintaining healthy and productive relationships with other student governing bodies of the University is vital to making the most of our time here. Learning about other groups and what's important to them can only make us 1) a more informed organization ourselves, and 2) and more cohesive unit as a student body. I would love to see cooperation and collaboration between other various student groups. In particular, I think my ability to take initiative can assist in bridging the gap between our two campuses. From my short time here, it seems as though Morningside and CUMC are states away, rather than 48 blocks. I think making more of a conscious effort to have events and stay connected with CUMC student governing groups has the potential to greatly enhance our academic and social experience at Columbia.  The Budget Committee is extremely important to an organization's operational efficiency. I think that my experience working as a finance chair and advisor to the treasurer for some student organizations will help me both review budget proposals and make the necessary distribution of funds. I would also hope that this involvement leads to more collaboration with these recognized student groups and perhaps being able to take part in some of the events that they plan.","","May 2021","https://www.jotform.com/uploads/nikul@egsc.seas.columbia.edu/42444463566964/350449359131239924/Photo_Sutton.jpg"

To this end, I revamped the philanthropy chair position and established annual events with St. Luke's Hospital and PurpleStride, a 5k run/walk raising funds for pancreatic cancer research. I also worked with EGSC to organize volunteers for New York Cares Day. As vice president, I aided in the planning and execution of Interview Weekend for potential MS and PhD students, and as academic/career chair, I am currently working to re-establish a young alumni panel in collaboration with the Society for Biomaterials. Additionally, as a recipient of NSF GRFP, I am spearheading a workshop specifically for biomedical engineers applying for the fellowship.  Outside of the biomedical engineering department, I am chair of the Columbia Graduate Council (CGC). Through CGC, I am working with students and administrators from across Columbia's graduate schools to organize FestiFall, an approximately 2,000 person event open to all graduate students. Through this endeavor, CGC has raised ~$24,000 and counting, and has worked with University Events Management and Financial Advising to ensure the event will be a success.   After working briefly with EGSC to plan New York Cares Day, I am interested in getting more involved.

However, the social committee could improve in making the events accessible to everyone. In my experience working with graduate students, many do not read all of their e-mails or even know how to sign up for EGSC's mailing list, so they are unaware that these great social events are occurring. On the social committee, I would aim to reach out to as many SEAS students as possible. Other groups have had success recruiting members in person by going lab-to-lab and talking about their events. I think EGSC would benefit from this. I have experience in recruiting members to the groups I am a part of, and would love to get involved in this.  I would like EGSC to work more closely with CGC on interschool issues. As chair of CGC, I could act as a liaison between the groups. CGC was recently established and we are looking for opportunities to collaborate with other groups, such as EGSC, to bring more interschool meetups to the university.  Since I have worked with SEAS administrators for CGC, I am interested in the academic affairs committee to learn more about what the committee does and how EGSC can impact the university at a higher level than SEAS.","","May 2020","https://www.jotform.com/uploads/nikul@egsc.seas.columbia.edu/42444463566964/350630324905591716/CZM%20photo.jpg"
