                            <h3>Please describe any relevant past experience</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I served as an ambassador for the IEOR department in the past year and interviewed over 70 candidates for various programs in the department. Additionally, I took the initiative and contacted my undergraduate school, University of Waterloo, about hosting potential recruiting events for the IEOR department's programs. As a result, I received the outstanding service award from the department last year. Currently, I am one of the vice-presidents of Columbia University Chinese Student and Scholar Association. My main duty is to coordinate with various departments such as technical support services, student events, outside vendors, and other clubs to ensure smooth logistics for various events. I am currently in charge of hosting the Huawei recruiting event for next month and the association's internal training program for new members</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">SEAS is a diverse department with students not just in the traditional engineering programs, but in some of the most competitive and cutting edge industries as well. For the career development committee, I hope we would be able to bring in more recruiting companies from more diverse backgrounds to match that of our talented students. As a financial engineering student, I think I have a unique perspective of a student that is adamant in pursuing a banking career but starting with a engineering degree, which is a non-traditional banking program.Having successfully worked over the summer in bank and networked with successful alumnus from various finance fields, I think would be able utilize that network to bring about change for the department. Additionally, my experience at CUCSSA over the past few months offers me a better insight into the inner workings of the school's administrative process and I can use these knowledge to contribute to the committee.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I was the collaboration and outreach chair in Phi Sigma Theta National Honor Society in the Ohio State University Chapter.  I coordinated groups for Phi Sigma Theta NHS at OSU to team up for social and service events. I planned and helped to execute social and service events. I also Invited members from near Phi Sigma Theta Chapters for regional gathering.  </p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">One thing that graduate students concern most about is job searching, and networking is one of the most critical parts of it. I would try my best to use my previous outreach experience to help make more connections among alumni, employers and students, which I think is very helpful and beneficial for our students.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">In my undergraduate studies, I was elected the General Secretary of the Student Council for the academic year 2014-2015 and I was elected as the President of the Student COuncil for the academic year 2015-2016. I have had the exact same experience as the EGSC by raising the concern of the students in front of the student council.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">First thing that I could propose  is how we could give the new students a better insight on how to go about the registration process by giving them better information on the subject and its prerequisites.  Secondly, regularly (or atleast twice) taking feedback from the students  with respect to different courses that they are enrolled for and what are their feedback to improve the course structure. Thirdly,  being a new graduate students I am not aware of it yet, but if possible increasing the possibility of on campus jobs for the students in their first semester and having a accessibility to apply for it in the first semester. Lastly, if the EGSC could organize more networking events like the barbecue lunch which was organised in initial week for the new incoming students. This could increase networking among students and also they can tae a break from their busy academic life.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Worked as an executive in the Mechanical Engineering Association (MEA) during my undergraduate studies. Was in-charge of various events that include, setting up various departmental events, representing the department during university events like "Tathva" (University Technical Fair), being the first avenue of support for undergraduate freshers, etc. Also worked as a campus ambassador for Twenty19.com for almost an year, where I had to represent the company and conduct talks regarding the importance of internships. Going back to high school, also worked as the School Head Boy, newspaper editor, etc.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">As an Operations Research student, the main thing in my opinion is to convert the group into a well-oiled machine. Efficiency and effectiveness are of prime importance to me. Students will always feel a bit insecure or uncomfortable when they have to reach out to a professor. I hope to conduct events and lend out a hand to students such that they don't have to feel that way. With help from us, students can take in a proper "Columbia University Experience" instead of having to fret over academic, career or any other issues. I would also like to introduce in many new events that catch the eye of both students and professors. Even though I have mentioned three preferences above, I would like to take part in almost every committee, whenever possible.</p>
                            <h3>Any other relevant information you would like to share</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I am not sure if this qualifies as relevant past experience, but I was also part of a team of students that coordinated with a few professors to setup evening coaching classes for various mechanical engineering software packages in my undergraduate university. I even was part of the teaching staff; I taught the basics of Ansys A.P.D.L to a lot of students, some of whom were both graduate and doctorate students.</p>
