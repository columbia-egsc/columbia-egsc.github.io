                            <p style="text-align: justify;">1- I was sponsorship committee head for my undergraduate college national level techno- management fest
2 - I have also organized a special event for the same fest</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I learned a lot while working as the manager and as committee head and I would like to implement those learning here. Few of them are:
1 - Being transparent with the fellow committee members and non committee members. It was utmost necessary because I was dealing with huge sum of money. A large portion of my job also included allocation and managing of funds. Being detailed in description and reasoning and transparent with the faculty incharge, the vendors and the sponsors is must.
2- Be creative with the meetings and easily approachable. It's very important to maintain a good working relationship with the sponsors so that they are more than happy to come in the next event. Since it's a big University and not everyone knows everyone, organising a creative and fun Meetup helps people to approach you with their issues and certainly takes the edge off.
3- Open to feedback. I take healthy criticism/ negative feedback very positivily because one needs to adapt to the ever changing scenario to survive.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">My vision for the committees is to strengthen our students' connections with students from other  schools of Columbia University, with Columbia alumni, and with faculty members, through a positive and active student network featuring all kinds of social and cultural events, to which I could use my past experience in student organizations and programs to add value.</p>

                            <h3>Please describe any relevant past experience</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">During my time at UC San Diego, I aimed to fill my daily schedule with a wide-range of activities to improve my communication, social, and leadership skills. In addition to the fact that each activity uniquely contributed to my personality, these activities also led me to come across many individuals who left an indelible impact on me and helped me maximize my knowledge in different fields and cultures. 

Upon coming to UCSD, I noticed a lack of a Saudi community, so with the help of a fellow Saudi student, we founded the Saudi Student Association (SSA) to reflect the cultural and historical aspects of Saudi Arabia and to cultivate a sense of Saudi community within the university. Two years after being an integral part of the leadership team, UCSD has witnessed a drastic increase in the number of Saudis attending UCSD, from 9 students to a total of 56 students. 

Additionally, I joined the Engineers for a Sustainable World (ESW) organization. One year after being an active member in the organization, I became part of the Public Relations committee. This gave me the chance to help in career opportunities for students by contacting different companies and hosting information sessions for ESW. Those experiences allowed me to join the Emerging Leaders Program at UCSD, a program that aims to guide and inspire the development of leadership skills through experiential activities. To further hone my professional and leadership skills, I, along with other fellows, founded the SABIC Student Council to serve SABIC (a major global petrochemicals company) scholarship recipients. We came up with multiple initiatives that contributed to uniting the student body, such as a monthly newsletter and multiple professional development programs. The work our team has done led the council to be an integral part of the scholarship program.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">For the academics committee, one of the things I would like to contribute to is the pre-arrival orientation to help graduate students figure out their tentative plan prior to the start of their programs. With EGSC help, I am confident that we can come up with a clear system that covers all academia matters with the goal that every incoming student would have a clear understanding of the offered classes. This would include reflection videos from current cohorts on each course, and online conferences by current students and faculty for incoming students. The main goal of such an initiative would be to save current and incoming students time and money as well as to allow them to enjoy a hassle-free journey at Columbia University. For the social committee, although the IEOR department, along with EGSC, has done a great job in creating memorable social events/mixers, one of the things I will strive to improve upon, is having more faculty presence in those social events. In addition to the fact that this will give graduate students the opportunity to hear more about current IEOR research opportunities and different industries which they might get involved in, more student/faculty interaction in a less formal setting would drastically help students and faculty alike in various aspects. For the career affairs, I would like to assist in establishing a system that ensures that every student is getting the chance to sign up for different information sessions by inviting more companies and hosting those sessions in bigger auditoriums. On a general note, I aim to help in creating an accessible online tool for current students to raise any questions or concerns which would redefine the goals and vision of EGSC by having diverse and varied opinions and contributions count.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">As an undergraduate student, pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science in India, Iâ€™ve often believe in participating and contributing to as many diverse experiences as I possibly could, be it as the head of the Accounts Department for the first every Model United Nations conference in my college, or as a member of the Computer Society of India, responsible for organizing conferences focused on educating students on latest trends in technology, or as an Exchange Controller at AIESEC â€“ VIT Chennai (the worldâ€™s largest non-profit youth run organization) responsible for marketing social internships all around the world, helping match university students with internships in global locations based on preference and requirement. Such experiences not only help build versatility, they allow one to respect challenges that various fields present (instead of undermining what one generally wouldnâ€™t understand). During my time at S&P Global Market Intelligence, I was managing a team of 20 individuals from distributed geographies like India, United States, United Kingdom, Pakistan, and was responsible for building and supporting a product that covered data for about 88,000 public companies, 825,000 private companies and in-depth global data for 17 industries. In parallel, we were actively engaged in building out new analytics solutions that helped improve product offerings for more than 900 clients who had registered with us. This experience taught me the following â€“ 1) Effective and regular communication is key for a business (or any group) to be sustainable and successful; 2) One should always be versatile and open to feedback, be it negative or positive; 3) One should always be respectful of different cultures and work ethic. These principles helped me brand myself as an â€˜Agent of Changeâ€™, allowing me to successfully deliver unmanageable product priorities against tight deadlines. Thus, I feel these experiences have allowed to be develop myself as a multi-tasker, an impactful communicator and a deferential human being.  </p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">The Alumni and Career Affairs Committee
Columbia University, as one of the pioneers in education, has been a hotbed of talent. Students, current and past, and from diverse cultures have done seminal work in their respective fields which continues to make Columbia a brand associated with academic excellence. It would be my objective to improve the Universityâ€™s outreach to such individuals (who are often very busy with their professional commitments). Additionally, given my experience in S&P Global (or the Financial Services Industry in general), where I got the opportunity to work with a few Columbia alumni, as well as accomplished professionals in the industry, I would like to increase the frequency of tech talks by individuals from companies like Kensho(an award winning machine intelligence company), S&P Global Market Intelligence, Barclays, JP Morgan etc. These are people Iâ€™ve worked with, and who understand how data in general is transforming the industries around us, thus making their experience very relevant to most of our programs at Columbia. Thus, as my vision for this committee, I would like to help improve our universityâ€™s connections with firms that have not been very actively associated with us, and improve our alumni outreach, holding regular networking sessions/talks that allows them to share their experience post Columbia. 

The Academic Affairs Committee
In any institutional setting, be it academic or professional, feedback is one of the key metrics that helps assess an entityâ€™s efficiency in execution of its daily duties. Universities, given their culturally and geographically diverse student populace, often find themselves at the forefront of unique and unexpected challenges. It thus becomes important to ensure that students have a platform that allows them to unequivocally voice their concerns, without any fear. To help facilitate such conversations, I feel it important to conduct feedback sessions with relevant authorities by organizing regular (twice a month) sessions with a relatively small group of randomly selected students that would share issues/suggestions on topics that are important to them. Such sessions (in my professional experience), often allow students, hitherto silent and passive in communicating concerns, to speak up. Thus, as my vision for this committee, I would like to focus on improving transparency and accessibility, thereby allowing relevant feedback being shared with proper authorities.

The Interschool Committee
Co-operation and collaboration â€“ these are two words that are key in this era of globalization.  The synergy of distributed and individual bodies is the â€˜mantraâ€™ for effective and organic growth. As an individual whoâ€™s managed i) a team distributed over multiple geographies like United States, United Kingdom, Pakistan, India; ii) clients that come from different industries, with different requirements and temperaments; I feel thatâ€™s itâ€™s imperative to be a good listener and an effective communicator. Articulating oneâ€™s thought clearly is key to maintaining good relations with people around you, and I feel (even though it is a practice that never really ends) that my professional experience has helped me realize this. Additionally, itâ€™s important to be open to feedback, since when youâ€™re engaging with diverse student bodies, one is often faced with opinions that may be different from your own. Evaluating perspectives with an open mind (which may even mean admitting your folly) helps build positive and collaborative relationships with people.</p                        </div>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I believe strongly in equality within academic settings for people of different
socioeconomic status, genders, races, and ethnicities. A university department should bring people from diverse backgrounds to lead and succeed together. Since being part of Career Affairs, Inter-school or Social Committee would
allow me to speak for students in the IEOR department, I am excited about and, fully committed to, the prospect of becoming a department representative.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;"> Our society has changed tremendously over the past decades, but carving out a scientific career remains difficult for young women. From high school through college, I encountered strong institutional biases and personal stereotypes on a daily basis, and I saw male peers receive more favorable treatment than women with the same qualifications. This fact did not stop me from seeking progression; rather, it inspired me to prove that women can succeed at the highest level. With my quantitative ability and my determination to stand out, I ultimately earned the China National Scholarship, the countryâ€™s highest academic recognition, granted only to the top 0.02% of undergraduates. </p>
