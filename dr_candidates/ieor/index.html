                            <p style="text-align: justify;">1- I was sponsorship committee head for my undergraduate college national level techno- management fest
2 - I have also organized a special event for the same fest</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I learned a lot while working as the manager and as committee head and I would like to implement those learning here. Few of them are:
1 - Being transparent with the fellow committee members and non committee members. It was utmost necessary because I was dealing with huge sum of money. A large portion of my job also included allocation and managing of funds. Being detailed in description and reasoning and transparent with the faculty incharge, the vendors and the sponsors is must.
2- Be creative with the meetings and easily approachable. It's very important to maintain a good working relationship with the sponsors so that they are more than happy to come in the next event. Since it's a big University and not everyone knows everyone, organising a creative and fun Meetup helps people to approach you with their issues and certainly takes the edge off.
3- Open to feedback. I take healthy criticism/ negative feedback very positivily because one needs to adapt to the ever changing scenario to survive.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">My vision for the committees is to strengthen our students' connections with students from other  schools of Columbia University, with Columbia alumni, and with faculty members, through a positive and active student network featuring all kinds of social and cultural events, to which I could use my past experience in student organizations and programs to add value.</p>
