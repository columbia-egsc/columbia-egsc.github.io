                            <h3>Please describe any relevant past experience</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Worked as an executive in the Mechanical Engineering Association (MEA) during my undergraduate studies. Was in-charge of various events that include, setting up various departmental events, representing the department during university events like "Tathva" (University Technical Fair), being the first avenue of support for undergraduate freshers, etc.
 Also worked as a campus ambassador for Twenty19.com for almost an year, where I had to represent the company and conduct talks regarding the importance of internships.
 Going back to high school, also worked as the School Head Boy, newspaper editor, etc.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">As an Operations Research student, the main thing in my opinion is to convert the group into a well-oiled machine. Efficiency and effectiveness are of prime importance to me. Students will always feel a bit insecure or uncomfortable when they have to reach out to a professor. I hope to conduct events and lend out a hand to students such that they don't have to feel that way. With help from us, students can take in a proper "Columbia University Experience" instead of having to fret over academic, career or any other issues. I would also like to introduce in many new events that catch the eye of both students and professors. Even though I have mentioned three preferences above, I would like to take part in almost every committee, whenever possible.</p>
                            <h3>Any other relevant information you would like to share</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I am not sure if this qualifies as relevant past experience, but I was also part of a team of students that coordinated with a few professors to setup evening coaching classes for various mechanical engineering software packages in my undergraduate university. I even was part of the teaching staff; I taught the basics of Ansys A.P.D.L to a lot of students, some of whom were both graduate and doctorate students.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">In my undergraduate studies, I was elected the General Secretary of the Student Council for the academic year 2014-2015 and I was elected as the President of the Student COuncil for the academic year 2015-2016. I have had the exact same experience as the EGSC by raising the concern of the students in front of the student council.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">First thing that I could propose  is how we could give the new students a better insight on how to go about the registration process by giving them better information on the subject and its prerequisites.
 Secondly, regularly (or atleast twice) taking feedback from the students  with respect to different courses that they are enrolled for and what are their feedback to improve the course structure.
 Thirdly,  being a new graduate students I am not aware of it yet, but if possible increasing the possibility of on campus jobs for the students in their first semester and having a accessibility to apply for it in the first semester.
 Lastly, if the EGSC could organize more networking events like the barbecue lunch which was organised in initial week for the new incoming students. This could increase networking among students and also they can tae a break from their busy academic life.</p>

                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">One thing that graduate students concern most about is job searching, and networking is one of the most critical parts of it. I would try my best to use my previous outreach experience to help make more connections among alumni, employers and students, which I think is very helpful and beneficial for our students.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Most of graduate students at Engineering School are aiming to find a better job after graduation. And needless to say, career developing plays an important part through job searching process. In my opinion, the duty in Career Development committee or is highly connected to graduate students' right-on problems. I would like to serve as a liaison between department and students, helping both sides accomplish tasks effectively and efficiently.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Currently studying Operations Research at Columbia. My past background is fairly fragmented in a diversified way so that I am very much inspired by meeting new people among the community and would be more than thrilled to try to understand them. For freshmen year I majored in Korean - then I transferred to the Economics and Finance Department during my second year in college and during my third year, I exchanged to Upenn to broaden my horizon. I am passionate about finance, engineering, traveling and event-planning. </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Living alone and taking transitions in different places over the past 3 years, I am good at budget planning and forecasting what to expect on the road for an entity; Starting from a young  age, I always attach great importance to studying and enlarging horizons and thus am familiar with how to promote the process in an effective and how to help out others regarding academics; for my freshman year, I was the group leader of 6 people and our team was specifically managing the social part  at the student union. Therefore, I am confident that I will be committed to the work as well as enjoying myself collaborating with other team members around me.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Four years ago, I joined the overseas student association in my hometown as a core member and became the vice president in one year.  During that time, I led a team of 10 core members and we organized four annual events with over 100 participants;planned and organized a major professional event with over 100 participants and 5 local companies; organized a Charity Bazaar and raised 6000RMB for a charity funded school in Gansu, China. In my sophomore year during undergraduate study, I joined a start-up project as the treasurer. In addition, I also helped with generating new ideas and predicted costs and profits of the project.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">In my daily life, I am used to be a optimizer and I always make maximum utility out of minimum effort. I hope to bring this to help EGSC's budget committees so that EGSC can make most out of its budget to bring students as many good events as possible. I wish to improve the budget spending of the department by keeping good track of the spending and eliminate unnecessary costs.</p>
