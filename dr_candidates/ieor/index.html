                            <p style="text-align: justify;">1- I was sponsorship committee head for my undergraduate college national level techno- management fest
2 - I have also organized a special event for the same fest</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I learned a lot while working as the manager and as committee head and I would like to implement those learning here. Few of them are:
1 - Being transparent with the fellow committee members and non committee members. It was utmost necessary because I was dealing with huge sum of money. A large portion of my job also included allocation and managing of funds. Being detailed in description and reasoning and transparent with the faculty incharge, the vendors and the sponsors is must.
2- Be creative with the meetings and easily approachable. It's very important to maintain a good working relationship with the sponsors so that they are more than happy to come in the next event. Since it's a big University and not everyone knows everyone, organising a creative and fun Meetup helps people to approach you with their issues and certainly takes the edge off.
3- Open to feedback. I take healthy criticism/ negative feedback very positivily because one needs to adapt to the ever changing scenario to survive.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">My vision for the committees is to strengthen our students' connections with students from other  schools of Columbia University, with Columbia alumni, and with faculty members, through a positive and active student network featuring all kinds of social and cultural events, to which I could use my past experience in student organizations and programs to add value.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">During my time at UC San Diego, I aimed to fill my daily schedule with a wide-range of activities to improve my communication, social, and leadership skills. In addition to the fact that each activity uniquely contributed to my personality, these activities also led me to come across many individuals who left an indelible impact on me and helped me maximize my knowledge in different fields and cultures. 

Upon coming to UCSD, I noticed a lack of a Saudi community, so with the help of a fellow Saudi student, we founded the Saudi Student Association (SSA) to reflect the cultural and historical aspects of Saudi Arabia and to cultivate a sense of Saudi community within the university. Two years after being an integral part of the leadership team, UCSD has witnessed a drastic increase in the number of Saudis attending UCSD, from 9 students to a total of 56 students. 

Additionally, I joined the Engineers for a Sustainable World (ESW) organization. One year after being an active member in the organization, I became part of the Public Relations committee. This gave me the chance to help in career opportunities for students by contacting different companies and hosting information sessions for ESW. Those experiences allowed me to join the Emerging Leaders Program at UCSD, a program that aims to guide and inspire the development of leadership skills through experiential activities. To further hone my professional and leadership skills, I, along with other fellows, founded the SABIC Student Council to serve SABIC (a major global petrochemicals company) scholarship recipients. We came up with multiple initiatives that contributed to uniting the student body, such as a monthly newsletter and multiple professional development programs. The work our team has done led the council to be an integral part of the scholarship program.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">For the academics committee, one of the things I would like to contribute to is the pre-arrival orientation to help graduate students figure out their tentative plan prior to the start of their programs. With EGSC help, I am confident that we can come up with a clear system that covers all academia matters with the goal that every incoming student would have a clear understanding of the offered classes. This would include reflection videos from current cohorts on each course, and online conferences by current students and faculty for incoming students. The main goal of such an initiative would be to save current and incoming students time and money as well as to allow them to enjoy a hassle-free journey at Columbia University. For the social committee, although the IEOR department, along with EGSC, has done a great job in creating memorable social events/mixers, one of the things I will strive to improve upon, is having more faculty presence in those social events. In addition to the fact that this will give graduate students the opportunity to hear more about current IEOR research opportunities and different industries which they might get involved in, more student/faculty interaction in a less formal setting would drastically help students and faculty alike in various aspects. For the career affairs, I would like to assist in establishing a system that ensures that every student is getting the chance to sign up for different information sessions by inviting more companies and hosting those sessions in bigger auditoriums. On a general note, I aim to help in creating an accessible online tool for current students to raise any questions or concerns which would redefine the goals and vision of EGSC by having diverse and varied opinions and contributions count.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">As an undergraduate student, pursuing my Bachelors in Computer Science in India, I’ve often believe in participating and contributing to as many diverse experiences as I possibly could, be it as the head of the Accounts Department for the first every Model United Nations conference in my college, or as a member of the Computer Society of India, responsible for organizing conferences focused on educating students on latest trends in technology, or as an Exchange Controller at AIESEC – VIT Chennai (the world’s largest non-profit youth run organization) responsible for marketing social internships all around the world, helping match university students with internships in global locations based on preference and requirement. Such experiences not only help build versatility, they allow one to respect challenges that various fields present (instead of undermining what one generally wouldn’t understand). During my time at S&P Global Market Intelligence, I was managing a team of 20 individuals from distributed geographies like India, United States, United Kingdom, Pakistan, and was responsible for building and supporting a product that covered data for about 88,000 public companies, 825,000 private companies and in-depth global data for 17 industries. In parallel, we were actively engaged in building out new analytics solutions that helped improve product offerings for more than 900 clients who had registered with us. This experience taught me the following – 1) Effective and regular communication is key for a business (or any group) to be sustainable and successful; 2) One should always be versatile and open to feedback, be it negative or positive; 3) One should always be respectful of different cultures and work ethic. These principles helped me brand myself as an ‘Agent of Change’, allowing me to successfully deliver unmanageable product priorities against tight deadlines. Thus, I feel these experiences have allowed to be develop myself as a multi-tasker, an impactful communicator and a deferential human being.  </p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">The Alumni and Career Affairs Committee
Columbia University, as one of the pioneers in education, has been a hotbed of talent. Students, current and past, and from diverse cultures have done seminal work in their respective fields which continues to make Columbia a brand associated with academic excellence. It would be my objective to improve the University’s outreach to such individuals (who are often very busy with their professional commitments). Additionally, given my experience in S&P Global (or the Financial Services Industry in general), where I got the opportunity to work with a few Columbia alumni, as well as accomplished professionals in the industry, I would like to increase the frequency of tech talks by individuals from companies like Kensho(an award winning machine intelligence company), S&P Global Market Intelligence, Barclays, JP Morgan etc. These are people I’ve worked with, and who understand how data in general is transforming the industries around us, thus making their experience very relevant to most of our programs at Columbia. Thus, as my vision for this committee, I would like to help improve our university’s connections with firms that have not been very actively associated with us, and improve our alumni outreach, holding regular networking sessions/talks that allows them to share their experience post Columbia. 

The Academic Affairs Committee
In any institutional setting, be it academic or professional, feedback is one of the key metrics that helps assess an entity’s efficiency in execution of its daily duties. Universities, given their culturally and geographically diverse student populace, often find themselves at the forefront of unique and unexpected challenges. It thus becomes important to ensure that students have a platform that allows them to unequivocally voice their concerns, without any fear. To help facilitate such conversations, I feel it important to conduct feedback sessions with relevant authorities by organizing regular (twice a month) sessions with a relatively small group of randomly selected students that would share issues/suggestions on topics that are important to them. Such sessions (in my professional experience), often allow students, hitherto silent and passive in communicating concerns, to speak up. Thus, as my vision for this committee, I would like to focus on improving transparency and accessibility, thereby allowing relevant feedback being shared with proper authorities.

The Interschool Committee
Co-operation and collaboration – these are two words that are key in this era of globalization.  The synergy of distributed and individual bodies is the ‘mantra’ for effective and organic growth. As an individual who’s managed i) a team distributed over multiple geographies like United States, United Kingdom, Pakistan, India; ii) clients that come from different industries, with different requirements and temperaments; I feel that’s it’s imperative to be a good listener and an effective communicator. Articulating one’s thought clearly is key to maintaining good relations with people around you, and I feel (even though it is a practice that never really ends) that my professional experience has helped me realize this. Additionally, it’s important to be open to feedback, since when you’re engaging with diverse student bodies, one is often faced with opinions that may be different from your own. Evaluating perspectives with an open mind (which may even mean admitting your folly) helps build positive and collaborative relationships with people.</p                        </div>

socioeconomic status, genders, races, and ethnicities. A university department should bring people from diverse backgrounds to lead and succeed together. Since being part of Career Affairs, Inter-school or Social Committee would
allow me to speak for students in the IEOR department, I am excited about and, fully committed to, the prospect of becoming a department representative.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;"> Our society has changed tremendously over the past decades, but carving out a scientific career remains difficult for young women. From high school through college, I encountered strong institutional biases and personal stereotypes on a daily basis, and I saw male peers receive more favorable treatment than women with the same qualifications. This fact did not stop me from seeking progression; rather, it inspired me to prove that women can succeed at the highest level. With my quantitative ability and my determination to stand out, I ultimately earned the China National Scholarship, the country’s highest academic recognition, granted only to the top 0.02% of undergraduates. </p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">Alumni & Career Affairs: I believe that students can learn a lot and take advice from alumni's. Every students wants to get connected with alumni in the field/job  they are interested. Hence organizing the alumni meets by various field experts will be helpful for students. Also, mentor-mentee hasn't proved better way of approach since either students or alumni are reluctant to ask specific questions thinking to be on safer side. If we can provide piazza kind of platform where there is possibility of anonymity, i see that more question are posted. So i will plan to provide similar platform for alumni and students so that each party will be able to ask questions or post answers with anonymity. I believe this approach will break the ice between students and alumni</p>

As I was a liaison between the associate engineers and management, this experience is directly relevant to what I expect to do as an EGSC department representative.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">In addition to the Professional Development and Leadership program, I believe it would be immensely helpful to have a more involved mentorship program between current job-seeking students and students that have previously interned or are currently working in that subject area. These mentorship programs typically exist for high-demand, high-stress positions like investment banking or consulting, however, a broader platform that caters to students seeking any position would be ideal. This type of program would enable returning students (mentors) to become involved on campus while mentees would gain invaluable insight into their specific job function and recruiting process.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I am a first-year student at the MS in Operations Research program. During the last year of my undergrad I joined the local chapter of an international student association, AIESEC, that promotes youth leadership through transformative cultural experiences abroad. Within three months of joining the organization, I was elected to be Vice-president of Incoming Global Volunteers. In that role I was responsible for project conception and initiation, project planning and execution of community development programmes in Bogota (Colombia) and surrounding communities with the support and sponsorship of public and private universities, government agencies and private companies in Bogota.

I run and raised funds for 7 projects in education, human rights, environment, computer literacy, and organizational strengthening of NGOs. More than 100 international volunteers from 21 countries and different backgrounds participated. It represented a growth of 65% of our revenues and a growth of 320% in volunteers recruited. I improved social media management, CRM, and analytics on traffic sources; as result conversion rates increased from 60% to 85% and average conversion time decreased from 45 days to 10 days

In 2015 I moved to Mexico City and worked as consultant for a governmental agency and a digital marketing agency for about three years. With the former, I advised small and medium private companies in its strategy of Export and International Business Development. I helped American companies identify opportunities in Mexico and formulate strategies for entry into the Mexican market. With the latter, I developed a new product portfolio and defined the marketing strategy of digital products and services based on leading commercial business intelligence and artificial intelligence platforms.

These experiences have provided me with a strong foundation in project management and client-facing skills. They will allow me to be efficient and effective in the projects I engage in at EGSC. I can support EGSC to strengthen the relationship with the student body and to engage fundamental stakeholders to fulfill our vision. </p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">The selection of the committees was based on the synergies that can exist between them and how my skills, interest and knowledge align with them. I believe the digital media committee plays an important role in the achievement of EGSC vision and mission. In order to be able to serve the graduate students of the engineering school there has to be an effective communication where any student can reach us to express their ideas and concerns, and digital media plays an important role in this setting. Moreover, digital media is a very convenient way to invite and engage all students to our many social, career and alumni activities. I want to help consolidate this team and take advantage of the many opportunities there are to boost EGSC vision.

The alumni/career and social committees have a more direct impact accomplishing the mission of EGSC. They have created a vast network with prior students and members of the engineering school. I would like to contribute to the expansion and diversification of this network.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I was DR and on the Social Committee at EGSC for Spring 2018 term. I have also been School Representative at Office of Student Life since April 2018. Prior to Columbia, I served as Deputy Minister of Internal Liaison Department in University Student Union and a Start-up Club.</p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">After actively serving on the Social team for a semester and volunteering as Engineering School Representative at Office of Student Life, I believe I have more thoughts and passion and would like to continue serving in the EGSC big family. I've been to events held by other Schools (Law, SIPA), and  I found their events usually combined different elements(social+nice food, or games+bar+clubs), while our Carleton social was more often packed with food tasting not so good and merely socialising with people they've already known, while we should be aiming at more. Our Social Committee also have some great events like the Boat Cruise, and we should be developing more interesting social events for Grad Engineering Students.</p>

I would also like to make a video, available to public, in which the alumni answer common questions that students generally have.
If I get a chance to work in the Interschool team, I would to organize talks by eminent personalities who are of interest to all the participating schools. On the sidelines of such an event, students from different institutes will also get a chance to network.
With the budget team, I would like to raise funds from corporate sponsors and utilize that money to host inspirational as well career related talks for the benefit of students..</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I am a founding member of the IEOR PhD student group. We organize student seminars as an opportunity for practice talks before conferences, and organize department socials such as hiking and BBQs. Through these events, I have improved my organizational skills and have also developed closer relationship with my fellow PhD students. I get to see students' major concerns, and things we can change to make our graduate studies experience better. Also, I have been a teaching assistant for three semesters at Columbia (head TA for two semesters), and a tutor and lab assistant for two years in my undergraduate institute. These jobs have trained me to better understand students’ questions and concerns, clearly explain related knowledge points and problem solving steps. Furthermore, I have become better at handling class logistics and communicating with professors about issues related to students’ understanding of the material, classroom environment, exam related issues, etc.. </p>
                            <h3>What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h3>
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I want to better represent the PhD students in our department, especially to speak up for female students, a minority in our PhD program and in engineering school as a whole. I will actively communicate with my fellow students to collect their concerns, suggestions, and feedbacks, and bring them up in EGSC meetings. I will also advocate the efforts EGSC has put in to improve our graduate experience, as well as related opportunities at or offered by EGSC..</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">For many years, IEOR PhDs are underrepresented in EGSC. The situation changed only last semester when two students in our program became DRs. I hope, by applying to EGSC, we will have at least one IEOR PhD DR this semester.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">If elected to the Alumni and Career Affairs committee, in addition to organising alumni and career events, I would like to create a centralised database from where present engineering grad students can easily find alumni working at companies of their choice. Can achieve this by getting permission from relevant authorities to share the contact information and placements of recent graduate students who agree to the same. I would also like to create some kind of shared resource bank of materials needed to prepare for interviews, available for all engineering graduate students. I would like to create a mentorship program with interested alumni who can guide students through their careers. 

As a member of the academic affairs committee, I would like to hold some type of open forum especially before during registration, so that students can raise any concerns they have about academic policies and these can be effectively dealt with.</p>

I was recruited for this position after a series of group discussions, team activities, and stress interviews to make sure I can handle this commitment with rigor. As the Training Head, I was responsible for placement training and career guidance to over 400 undergraduate students from across 11 departments of engineering and sciences. To achieve this, I spearheaded a 3-day training workshop comprising of mock interviews, group discussions and aptitude tests before the start of the placement semester. During the rest of the semester, I was always approachable to students needing assistance, and for those who required more training, I successfully negotiated with the university officials to release funds providing free training services to students who were yet to receive any job offers. I believe this experience, when at the same time I had to prepare for my own placement, truly displays my level of commitment. I would like to continue this as a department representative of IEOR and hope that I get all your support with this.</p>

                            <p style="text-align: justify;">I would like to be a part of the Alumni and Career Affairs. For this committee, I would like EGSC to organize networking sessions with students and alumni together to directly open up opportunities for students seeking employment. We all know referral is the best way to get into any firm and with Columbia University having such a great alumni stronghold across different industries, we can really leverage this edge that we have. I believe I can contribute to this goal as I have prior experience of reaching out to alumni of my undergrad institution. I have organized numerous talks by alumni about their career trajectories and information sessions about their industry domains to make the students more aware of the latest trends and paradigm shifts.
Second, I would want the committee to also look into on campus part time employment. Such opportunities could be extremely important, especially for international students. Informing the students about them through regular updates or creating a better structured application process for such opportunities via EGSC could eliminate the endeavor of regular checking handshake or the IEOR job portal..</p>

I would create catalyst bucket for each budget track & will try to track it with analytics tool (with my Analytical tools learnings in Business Analytics program @ Columbia) so as to effectively utilize the budget for specific activities.
•        Merging technology with these committees: Being a student of Business Analytics at Columbia and having used Google Analytics in my earlier projects, gives me an added advantage to use Analytics tools to perform better analysis out of the survey conducted in the past years for academic affairs. I would try to improve the survey with my findings in such a way that it enhances the academic life of students at Columbia
•        Would try to conduct a flash mob performance to improve the reachability of our Social events.</p>
