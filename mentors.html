    <h1>PEER MENTOR</h1>

   <p> For many students, transitioning to graduate student life can be overwhelming. We, at EGSC, recognize the challenges students face during this period and understand the impact it may have on an individual’s experience at Columbia Engineering. It is our goal to help students take full advantage of what Columbia and New York City has to offer. </p>

  <p>  The mentorship program connects students with mentors who can help them navigate life as a graduate student. Our mentors have been through the challenges students face before and can offer assistance in a variety of ways to help student achieve their goals both during their time at Columbia and beyond. </p>

   <p> Below, we have compiled profiles of our mentors separated by departments. To better match you with the perfect mentor, we have created the following categories of interests: </p>


   <p> <b>Academics / Goals</b> – Choosing which courses to take can be one of the most frustrating decisions you make as a graduate student, especially if you’re new to Columbia. We can help identify and recommend classes that fit your interests. </p>
  <p>  <b>Graduate Student Life</b> – Many students find graduate student life daunting. We’re here to help you find a balance between academics, research, and social life to take advantage of the best Columbia and NYC has to offer. </p>
   <p> <b>Getting to Know NYC</b> – If you’re new to NYC, you’ll find that the amount of things you can do can get overwhelming. We can make suggestions on things to do, places to visit, where to eat, and shows to watch.</p>
  <p>  <b>Career (job/internship)</b> - Are you looking for a full-time job or summer internship? We’ve been through this process and are here to help assist you in any way we can. We can critique resumes, aid in job search, and even help you prepare for interviews.</p>
  <p>  <b>Student Involvement/Activities</b> - There are plenty of things to do at Columbia University outside of academics. If you’re looking for ways to get involved at any level or simply wondering what events are happening around campus, we’re here to help.</p>
   <p> <b>Getting Out</b> – There is more to the east coast than NYC. Come talk to us if you’re looking for things to do outside of the city or just want to plan a getaway trip. I hear Hawaii is beautiful this time of year. </p>
  <p>  <b>Networking</b> - We’ve all heard the phrase, “Network! Network, Network!” We’re here to help you put yourself out there and will try to connect you with the right people so you can achieve your goals. </p>
  <p>  <b>General Advice</b> - Ask me anything! If you have a general questions or your questions don’t fit in any of the above categories, just ask us.</p>

  <p>  If you are interested in becoming a mentor, please contact the EGSC Vice President at vp@egsc.seas.columbia.edu.</p>

                    <p><i>
“I am motivated to be a peer mentor because I believe community-building and mental health resources are not always appropriately emphasized in graduate school. Graduate students have already learned independence and self-reliance in college, and many have taken several years off from their studies to work full-time before matriculating. For these reasons, faculty and administrators may wrongly assume there is less need for mentorship and guidance throughout graduate education because the students are more mature. This translates into fewer resources overall for graduate students during a time of intense responsibility and educational rigor; therefore, initiatives like the Peer Mentoring Program are crucial to filling this void.”

Now that I am thankfully done with this phase, and I know how challenging it can be at times for incoming students, I would be very happy to serve as a mentor to new/younger students who came in this semester or may be coming any time in the future. I would love to share my experience and insight to guide them through their adaptation phase to Columbia and to graduate studies in general.”</i>
