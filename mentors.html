					<p style="text-align: justify;">For many students, transitioning to graduate student life can be overwhelming. We, at EGSC, recognize the challenges students face during this period and understand the impact it may have on an individual’s experience at Columbia Engineering. It is our goal to help students take full advantage of what Columbia and New York City has to offer.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The mentorship program connects students with mentors who can help them navigate life as a graduate student. Our mentors have been through the challenges students face before and can offer assistance in a variety of ways to help student achieve their goals both during their time at Columbia and beyond.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Below, we have compiled profiles of our mentors separated by departments. To better match you with the perfect mentor, we have created the following categories of interests:</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Academics/Goals</strong>: Choosing which courses to take can be one of the most frustrating decisions you make as a graduate student, especially if you’re new to Columbia. We can help identify and recommend classes that fit your interests.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Graduate Student Life</strong>: Many students find graduate student life daunting. We are here to help you find a balance between academics, research, and social life to take advantage of the best Columbia and NYC has to offer.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Getting to Know NYC</strong>: If you are new to NYC, you will find that the amount of things you can do can get overwhelming. We can make suggestions on things to do, places to visit, where to eat, and shows to watch.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Career (Job/Internship)</strong>: Are you looking for a full-time job or summer internship? We have been through this process and are here to help assist you in any way we can. We can critique resumes, aid in job search, and even help you prepare for interviews.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Student Involvement/Activities</strong>: There are plenty of things to do at Columbia University outside of academics. If you are looking for ways to get involved at any level or simply wondering what events are happening around campus, we are here to help.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Getting Out</strong>: There is more to the east coast than NYC. Come talk to us if you are looking for things to do outside of the city or just want to plan a getaway trip.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Networking</strong>: We have all heard the phrase, “Network! Network! Network!” We are here to help you put yourself out there and will try to connect you with the right people so you can achieve your goals.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>General Advice</strong>: Ask me anything! If you have a general questions or your questions do not fit in any of the above categories, just ask us.</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify;">I have a lot of interests from watching TED and movies to dancing and organizing events. I am also a member of Traditional China dance at Columbia University (CU China Dance). I have performed for Lunar New Year 2016, Columbia Night Market and several charity events. I love initiating and organizing study groups, believing that discussion can deepen our understanding of knowledge.</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">Back in my undergrad, I had been the president of the Peer Student Advising Center for my institute for over two years. I felt real passion and happiness while organizing both group workshops and individual consulting sessions.

							<p style="text-align: justify;">"I am a 3rd year PhD student in Columbia. Doing PhD was one of the best choices I made in my life. Till the very beginning, I was lucky enough to work on an innovative research topic that I am really into. I guess that was my main advantage, self-motivation. My work was based on a crowdsourcing-induced vibration-based SHM platform, a platform that can monitor vibrations from buildings with the help of smartphone users. Too much computation, programming, and mathematics made it even more joyful. While doing that, I participated in so many club activities like ballroom dance and kung fu. Not just because it is possible to do both, but also it is essential to keep my perspective wide. Columbia community has so much to offer, we should embrace it and be a part of it. To conclude, especially for people who are seeking a smooth, less painful, and sustainable PhD life, I might have a few tips."</p>

							<p style="text-align: justify;">"I'm a PhD candidate passionate about Science, nature and research. I love investigating the environment and being able to see things around me with a scientific perspective. I'm a bit introverted but love meeting new people and building life-long relationships. As an international student (I'm Brazilian!) I appreciate taking time to know more about other cultures and learn from other students' experiences. In NYC, I found crucial to have a community of friends you can count on for different things. Thus, I've actively involved in the organization of the Brazilian Researchers and Students Group in NY (PUB-NY) with the support of the Brazilian Consulate.</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">I've also volunteered for the past 3 years as student leader on campus ministry (InterVarsity Christian Fellowship) and outreach to the homeless in the City (Relief bus, don't walk by). Also, I love creating events for graduate students to get together and share their experiences: networking! (e.g. PUB-NY meetings, BRASCON - Brazilian Graduate Students Conference, Inter-Graduate Fellowship).</p>
							<p style="text-align: justify;">My experiences for the past years in networking, building relationships and mentoring my colleagues in the lab and in the EEE department, make me interest in the Peer Mentor Program! I think it is vital that graduate student have a balanced life and pursue extracurricular activities. Although I love doing research and science, I found the most relaxing and even inspirational moments when I'm walking around the city (Central Park!), talking to friends, sharing my anxieties and frustrations with experiments that are not going well, etc. I've learned that each one of us is unique and have a unique path to walk. Taking these moments of community building, enjoying nature and life or even experiencing some solitude, helps me get ready to keep doing what I love and at the same time without having the burden of comparing myself to any one. I've found peace as graduate student and I'd love to help others find their as well."</p>
