1
00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.350
Let's discuss plagiarism and
how to avoid it.

2
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.910
Your first question may be,
what is plagiarism?

3
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.460
Columbia University defines plagiarism
as the use of words, phrases, or ideas

4
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.470
belonging to another, without properly
citing or acknowledging the source.

5
00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.040
The important part of this sentence is the
second half, without properly citing or

6
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.140
acknowledging the source.

7
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.670
We all refer to other people's work when
writing our own papers or articles, but

8
00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.160
it is imperative that we cite
where those references came from.

9
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.520
This presentation will
cover the following topics.

10
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.540
Why do we cite sources?

11
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.420
What are the different
types of plagiarism?

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.400
What is a citation?

13
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.060
And when do you actually
cite your sources?

14
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.840
What are the different types of citations?

15
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.460
What are the best practices for
paraphrasing?

16
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.750
And how to cite sources.

17
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.780
Then we'll cover a brief introduction
on how to organize your citations and

18
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.490
then summarize everything
we have discussed.

19
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.850
To begin, we will talk about why
we cite sources and how to do so.

20
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.830
Citing sources is more than
just about avoiding plagiarism.

21
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.430
Acknowledging original sources
gives credit where credit is due.

22
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.330
By citing sources, you uphold intellectual
honesty and academic integrity.

23
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.490
Locating those references at the end of
your paper provides the full citation for

24
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.870
the original article so
readers can refer to the original source.

25
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.770
It also becomes easier to organize and
track your research process.

26
00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.010
Notice the nice layout of citations
at the end of this paper.

27
00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.018
It is easy to locate each
reference in this article, and

28
00:01:37.018 --> 00:01:40.360
to look up the full text
of the original sources.

29
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.200
Properly citing aids in citation analysis
or tracking the citation metrics.

30
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.150
This number, 98, refers to the times this
article has been cited in other places.

31
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.850
Citation metrics can be important for
academic respect or job promotions.

32
00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.070
Proper citations allow this number
to be calculated with accuracy.

33
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.050
There are many added benefits
to you as a researcher,

34
00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.160
more than just doing the right thing.

35
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.280
Pointing out which portions of your paper
are citations distinguishes your original

36
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.550
ideas, while demonstrating your
understanding of the existing literature.

37
00:02:17.211 --> 00:02:20.950
Incorporating current literature
into your work supports your ideas,

38
00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.070
and shows how your work connects to and
continues the work that has gone before.

39
00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:33.604
Providing proper citations enables your
readers to learn more by consulting your

40
00:02:33.604 --> 00:02:34.199
sources.

41
00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.220
You are able to lay claim to
credibility and authority for

42
00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.330
your work and
your place in the intellectual community

43
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.790
by comparing the current
literature on the topic at hand.

44
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.385
There are two types of plagiarism,
intentional and unintentional.

45
00:02:50.695 --> 00:02:53.765
Intentional plagiarism means you
know you are plagiarizing and

46
00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:55.965
you do not try to avoid it.

47
00:02:55.965 --> 00:02:58.305
This can mean you attempt
to cite your sources, but

48
00:02:58.305 --> 00:03:02.065
you do not bother to cite them
using a proper citation style.

49
00:03:02.065 --> 00:03:05.645
This is often seen as someone listing
a website where a quote came from but

50
00:03:05.645 --> 00:03:09.612
no other information about the source
such as the date or author.

51
00:03:09.612 --> 00:03:13.520
The worst type of intentional plagiarism
is trying to pass someone else's work off

52
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.850
as your own.

53
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.140
You are essentially stealing
someone else's ideas by doing this.

54
00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.580
You are doing yourself a disservice
because you do not learn anything new

55
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.809
if you do not do your own work.

56
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.040
To avoid intentional plagiarism,
always cite your sources and

57
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.040
do so using proper citation styles.

58
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:34.340
Unintentional plagiarism
is a bit stickier.

59
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.760
You may have used the proper citation
style for your bibliography, but

60
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.455
you forgot the in-text citations.

61
00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:45.900
You may have attempted to paraphrase
that citation, but you did so poorly.

62
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:54.890
You may have forgotten quotation
marks around a direct citation.

63
00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.690
Sometimes you forget to mark in your notes
whether an idea you jotted down was your

64
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.220
own or from something you read.

65
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.480
You may accidentally use
this in your paper and

66
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.430
not cite it thinking it was your own idea.

67
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.090
These are all types of unintentional
plagiarism, but they are still plagiarism.

68
00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.690
They best way to avoid unintentional
plagiarism is to take your time and

69
00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.480
stay organized during
the research process.

70
00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.540
You may now be asking
yourself what is a citation?

71
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.170
A citation is a reference to a source.

72
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.670
This is an example of a citation in
APA Style for a journal article.

73
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:35.940
The format for the citation you will be
using depends on the style required and

74
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.840
the format of the resource you used,
such as a book chapter or journal article.

75
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.120
The style may be dictated by the professor
you are doing an assignment for, or

76
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.620
a journal you are submitting
an article to.

77
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.350
Make sure you are using the correct
citation style requested.

78
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.190
For example,

79
00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.310
electrical engineering professors may
require you to use the IEEE Style Guide.

80
00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.110
Or if you are submitting a paper
to a journal such as Science,

81
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.120
the journal may require you
to use their style guide.

82
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.430
Be sure to inquire if a specific
citation style is required for

83
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.610
any paper or assignment.

84
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.060
You may be confused about when you
actually need to cite your sources.

85
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.570
You always need to cite whenever you
use any external sources in your work.

86
00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.380
If you include anything that is
not your own original thought,

87
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.110
you must cite where the idea originated.

88
00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.310
You have to cite facts that
are not common knowledge.

89
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.110
For example,

90
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:34.160
the sentence the Moon orbits the Earth is
a fact that does not need to be cited.

91
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.917
However, the claim that American chestnut
trees are nearly extinct may seem

92
00:05:37.917 --> 00:05:42.720
like fact, but needs to be supported by
a reference as it is not common knowledge.

93
00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:45.720
You have to site code that
you did not create yourself.

94
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.830
You have to site any paper you wrote for
a previous assignment or

95
00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.615
an article that was previously published.

96
00:05:50.615 --> 00:05:52.490
Self-plagiarism is plagiarism too.
