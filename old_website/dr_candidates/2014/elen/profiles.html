My vision in EGSC is to support SEAS students in achieving their academic excellence or career goals with passion and capability. Helping others to grasp opportunities and solving their problems will be my contribution to SEAS. Additionally, working with brilliant EGSC members will definitely improve my communication and cooperation skills and help me to pursue my career goal.

In my opinion, the work in Career Department or Alumni Affairs is to build a bridge between students and companies/alumnus. We should let companies/alumnus know students' needs and helping students benefit more from companies/alumnus we invited. These rely on good communications and broad surveys. I believe I can contribute to achieve this goal.

I&#039;ve been the anchor for the campus radio for two years. My program mainly focused on global political topics. I also did many interviews with students and faculty about their views of campus life or breaking news, and once with the Canadian Counsul Ms. Andrea Clark-Grignon during her visit to the university.
Also, I was the chief editor for a campus magazine for two years, which is all about students&#039; and faculty&#039;s recommendation of books, music and movies. That position gave me a good chance to communicate with many professors and alumni, and also improved my coordiantion ability.

Through several sessions and panels that were held by EGSC, I realized the importance of networking and alumni resources. So I want to be part of this active group that can help the SEAS students get more involved into the networking process  so as to make one step closer to finding an appropriate job after graduation.
Once I get to know the committee better, I&#039;ll definitely have many new ideas to make some progressive changes. For one thing, I&#039;m not sure if anyone from EGSC is working on this, but I realize a lot of us are international students, which enlightens me of the importance of international alumni. I know that probably many of our successful alumni are working overseas, and if we can build some kind of connection between them and our students, it&#039;ll be easier for us to seek a job overseas.

If I am given the opportunity to become the department representative and work with one of the committees, I would make sure that the work I do has a positive impact on the academic and social life of columbia students. This I believe can be achieved by integrating EGSC sponsored activities more thoroughly into the orientation schedule.  I would try to include ice breakers and other team building events in the orientation to make sure new incoming students feel more comfortable from day 1. The other most critical aspect I would work on is to facilitate collaboration between Columbia Business School and SEAS to help foster a culture of innovation, That would be beneficial for both schools.

1. Interschool:
To promote more collaboration among not only the Engineering and Science departments but also the other departments of Columbia University as a whole by organizing (A) Inter-Department Guest lectures (B) Networking events (C) Informal social events for students of various departments to interact.
Even though I am an Electrical Engineering graduate student, I myself am taking a class in Psychology department and one in Visual Arts department. Since I understand the inter connection of all the fields I believe I can serve more passionately to this committee.
 

2. Career Development:
To act as a bridge between CCE and students. I plan to promote Career development by conducting workshops related to developing soft skills and helping in organizing mock interviews. 

3. Academic Affairs:
To go through the problems current students are facing related to academic policies and bring required modifications so as to make the system school as well as student friendly.

I have helped students in past to get the jobs in the field they want. Usually students are not aware of the resources that are available to get into industry. So I think Career Development committee, I can help a lot.

I called atleast 6 companies in my undergrad college for on-campus placements. Most of companies come with the help of Alumni&#039;s, so I think I would be a good match for Alumni Affairs.

Academic Affairs: In my undergrads I was branch representative for 3 years. I know that there are always new problems and situations come that we never faced or thought of. Even in very difficult cases I have helped my colleagues to come over with their problems.

I believe it is extremely important to have a well-organized website and if I am chosen for this post, I am committed to make EGSC fully present on the Web and all social media (since they&#039;re part of our every second life and our first way of getting to know about things and events).

I have been a class leader since I was in primary school and all the way to college. In college, I was not only the monitor of my class, I am also the head of study and science department of our school student council in Shanghai Jiao Tong University. I have done a lot of work in my &quot;career&quot; before. For example, as a head of my department in student council of my college, I organized an Intelligence competition with over 950 people attended, an original little creation competition and a debate competition for all new student for our school. I hope these experience will be helpful if I am lucky enough to work in student council.
