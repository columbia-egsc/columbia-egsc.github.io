As an undergraduate student in the mechanical engineering department in my Chilean University, I was part of the diffusion team, helping high school students to solve all the doubts regarding the mechanical engineering career, the different specializations we had, and projections in the labor sphere.

I believe there is a deficiency in terms of sports for graduate students. Sports can be one of the best ways to meet people, enhancing leadership skills, teamwork, and sports are also good for physical and mental health. My goal is to create a space where every graduate student could practice what they want, make friends and join the community of engineering students.

I have some similar but varied past experience. 
- I was on the planning committee for a Student Youth convention which hosted about 500 students and was involved in some fundraising.
- I was involved in a group which organized different extra-curricular activities (like a programming club, electronics club) prime among which were study weekends around exam time.
- I participated in organizing elections for the Catholic student federation in my university for three years and was mandated to organize elections in department.
- I drew up the plan for the activities undertaken by the student organization in my department and secured the necessary external contacts for our excursion to a technological institute and for a guest talk
- I was involved in organizing a guest talk for my faculty.

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
On the whole, I hope to help EGSC be a better student body by encouraging more interaction between the students.
Course selection can be difficult at times and to help with this, creating a forum where students can get information about a course, a faculty, how to approach them, and about pertinent courses to pursue a certain specialization from other students should be of some benefit.
In the same vein, helping student know the opportunities out there and the skills required to pursue a certain career path would also be of benefit. There are also many activities which could be organized that would help prepare students for the world out there or for a PhD. e.g Courses in Organizational behavior, etiquette etc. I would hope to (with help) organize this to further enrich our Columbia experience.
Lastly I would be willing to work as part of the team to help achieve all the other EGSC goals, to help with the running of the body, and to be a good representative.

In an era of overlapping curriculum, interdisciplinary outlook has matured enough to create a parallel need for inter-school relations and even more so within  and between several graduate schools whether business, law, journalism, or  education.

My goal is to use a charismatic approach for the purpose of inter-school or inter-college connections within the SEAS community in particular and between the entire breadth of graduate schools within the university.

I see a potential for growing connections that can help foster healthy networking opportunities geared towards a spirit of entrepreneurial friendship that can grow from within graduate studies all the way to when we become part of the alumni.  

Inherently we make friends and connections at or within our comfort circles and this is what I aspire to break  by means of social low-key interactive avenues so that there would be a platform that creates an atmosphere of reaching out across the aisle to make meaningful associations within the schools and even between SEAS and Teachers College, Business, Law, Journalism and Medical  Schools.

<br><br>
      
     <h4 class="team-member-name">Any other information you would like to share</h4>
With two years of leadership role  as the programs chair and vice president respectively at the college of engineering of my home institution, I would want to gather such a seasoned experience of  working with people and advance it along with my maturity as a graduate student. This is my strategic tool and skill set based on which I would be able to work with a spirit of teamwork while driving personal initiatives and visionary perspectives that would benefit SEAS.

With a realistic view of how situations and priorities evolve, I am flexible enough to accommodate changes that would reflect periodic need for adjustment and renewed vision.

In the long haul I hope to use this platform to energize my aspirations for further leadership opportunities that would benefit SEAS and Columbia University for the opportunity I had to be admitted here in a form of an invitation to join a community of scholars who can come together and merge thoughts and ideas at an unprecedented level.

For the Career Development committee and Alumni Affairs Committee, I envision that they both blend together to  serve as a platform for exchange of ideas between the recent  graduates (Alumni) of the School and the current students. This shall help the students to learn more about the job market, additional skills sought after, if any. For the alumni too, this shall serve as a good networking platform.
To this end, I intend to hold numerous meetings, not necessarily within the campus, so that a good rapport is developed.

     <h4 class="team-member-name">Any other information you would like to share</h4>
I bring with me, an experience in organizing student-events during my under graduation which would help me conduct the events smoothly, ensuring benefits for all the participants involved. I have had numerous instances of success and failure in the past to know what works and what doesn&#039;t.
