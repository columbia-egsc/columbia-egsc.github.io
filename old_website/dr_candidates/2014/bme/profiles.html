I served as the EGSC department representative for biomedical engineering for the 2013-2014 academic year. I enjoyed working with and getting to know representatives from all departments in SEAS. EGSC is a very active and influential group in the Columbia community and I would love the opportunity to continue my involvement as a department representative to see our work as a student council go further and further. This past year, I worked on the Career and Alumni committee, helping to plan events such as the very successful first EGSC-sponsored alumni boat cruise. I have also reached out to many department administrators in an effort to gather contact information for SEAS alumni to develop an alumni database.

I have also served as the secretary of the Graduate Society of Women Engineers (2013) and am currently the Vice President of the BME Graduate Student group GraBME.

I would like to see a continued effort to either develop a database of contact information for SEAS alumni, or to tap into similar resources so that we can connect with alumni who would be interested helping us plan events with current SEAS students. These connections would serve as a way for current students to build their professional network to include SEAS alumni, which is a vast and invaluable resource. Having served on the Career and Alumni committee in the past, I have established connections withing SEAS departments that would allow for EGSC to bring this effort to the next step in reaching out to alumni. I think the Columbia Alumni LinkedIn groups would be a great resource to utilize for this effort.

I have served as the department representative for two previous years (2012, 2013-2014).  I also served as social chairman of EGSC for 2013.

In addition to my time in EGSC, I was previously President of Graduate Biomedical Engineering (GraBME) student group from 2012-2013, as well as Social Chairman from 2011-2012 and Intramurals Chairman (2013-2014).

I would like to continue the expansion of our interschool events. Often times it seems that our student body is content with remaining amongst other engineers.  However, it is critical for our future careers that we branch out and interact with those outside of science and engineering. I have a wealth of experience planning social and career events and have made contacts outside of GSAS that would greatly help our interschool efforts.

I am currently, as well as have been for the past year, the social chair of the graduate biomedical engineering student organization (GraBME). Through this position I have organized numerous social events with other departments, monthly brunch events, holiday events, and recently a very successful bowling event. 
During my undergraduate career I help positions of service chair, secretary, and dance team captain. As service chair I promoted, organized, and sponsored different service events around campus, coordinated events with other organizations, and logged service hours completed by each member. As secretary I recorded minutes during weekly meetings, maintained a calendar of events, and directed efficient meetings. As dance team captained I arranged a choreography and brought together a team to perform at various cultural college events. 
I was also the treasurer for an all male a cappella group at my undergraduate university. This position required me to manage semester budgets and other finances of the organization. 
<br><br>

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
My goal for the committees of my choice is to bring more people closer together and create a family atmosphere. I want more people to get to know each other and create connections and memories that will last a lifetime. My experience setting up and promoting events will make it easier for me to create opportunities for EGSC. I believe I can help push the boundaries of what becomes available for current students and the future of EGSC.

This semester I am only taking 9 credits worth of classes and therefore will be able to devote more time into organizations such as GraBME and EGSC.

I have worked before returning to school and know how to deal with the lows and highs of the industry and various shortcomings one faces at a personal level be. I have good interpersonal skills that will help build network outside the University (industry and academic level). Apart from this, I believe I can contribute towards attracting more Biomedical companies tailor-made to student needs.
