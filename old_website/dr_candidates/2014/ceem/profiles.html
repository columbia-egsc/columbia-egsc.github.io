I have organized and participated in a number of extra-curricular activities during my college days. For instance, I have worked as a voluntary counselor to graduate applicants. For the last four years, I have worked as a tutor for undergraduate students.
Plus, In my last college days,I was voted as one of the ten most promising students in my batch.
Finally, I believe that scientific researches and practical experience are two wings of progression. Therefore, only through close exposure to the industry, I will be able to put my knowledge into practice. So after three years of working, A group of brilliant alumni of SUT and I established a Design-Build Engineering firm, and I was elected as the CEO.

As a high-school student I served on the student body council and school newspaper. In my military service I commanded a course, which trained young recruits to their challenging occupation. While serving in this post I gained valuable experience that improved my leadership skills and learned the value of good leadership. Such leadership should be attentive yet firm resolute in its policy and vision. I applied these principles in my work and in my volunteer activates. During my work as a mechanical engineer I managed several projects and experiments, which further sharpen my leadership skills. Skills which I again used but in a different context of teaching under privileged high school students.

I graduated from Columbia in May, 2014 with a MS degree from CEEM department. Now I am a PhD student. The life in Columbia University changed my life. Besides the knowledge I gained from SEAS, I got clear about my goals, made loads of friends and made connections with professionals in the area. EGSC has been very supportive around the year. I tend to join this group to help it to become even better.

I was an active member of many undergraduate organizations at Syracuse University including Engineers Without Borders (EWB) and Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE). I was able to coordinate the interaction between both of these organizations to hold combined events for the students.

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
Since I was able to benefit from such committees as career development, I would like to participate in a similar organization that others can seek help from in order to find the benefits that networking can offer them. I would like to enforce and continue the positive impact and relationship that EGSC has with partnering companies in the NYC area as well as establish new partnerships with well reputed companies.
I would like to emphasize the support that administration can offer the student body so that students can take advantage of the resources offered to them.

Personally I&#039;d like to be involved into the academic affairs. My goal is to enhance and increase the communication between students, especially foreign students, and professors. I would like to schedule more academic events, like lab tour, academic Webinar etc. Many foreign students seldom attend the playing events, but they would be more likely to attend those academic events. 
I was a transfer student between Hunan University in China and Michigan Technological University in America, so I know about America better than other international students. At the same time it would be easier for me to invite foreign students to attend some events since I know them better than Americans.

I worked in Budget department of student union when I was freshman and sophomore in undergraduate. Our team worked on got some funds from companies to support events we were holding and we did a great job. After that , I worked in social department in student union for two years, we were hold two spring festival parties for civil engineering department, with 20 shows, and that was kind of cool because it was the only time when engineering students showing themselves like actors or actress every year in our school. On my graduate years, I worked in career development department in student union, and we invited some HR of bid companies to have little talk in our department, students could come to ask their confusions about industry, ask for internship opportunities,even find a job. And that was amazing, because students do have little chances to meet with HR, and these chances can help them out.
<br><br>

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
I worked in career development of students union before and I think it is meaningful, it helped our students, and also, can help me to do something about my future career. Sometimes, when we meet some experience people, it helps a lot. So I do want to join in this department now, and I hope to get the precious chance. After that, our team can hold some events ,inviting experienced people from industry, or columbia students who worked in our industry,I think the most important thing for students is to figure out what real work like, what they really want to do, be able to do, and with 100% passion to do.

I believe that I was born a somewhat introvert. But I love to talk to different people and learn different culture in private conversations. So I am actually attending the EGSC wanting to change that during my social activities so that I can be comfortable in a crowd and make more new friends. I am more than happy to help the union by being a communicator, an organizer and a coordinator.

I really want to help hold more social activities for the engineering students, in that case,we can both enrich school life and make more friends.In addition, these experiences will help us a lot for our future career. What&#039;s more, it can be possible for us to ask some of the alumni to give us a lecture which will be a great fortune. I am sure that knowledge is not the only wealth to us , these experiences will also be of great use for our future.
