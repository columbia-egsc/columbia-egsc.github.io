     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
Because my specialty and strong point is communication, organizing skills and publicity, I chose Social, Alumni Affairs and Interschool committees where I can best benefit EGSC.

If admitted, I will try my best to take advantage of this platform and organize innovative activities. What is more, I will make more Chinese students to take part in EGSC activities.

My goal for the Career Development Committee is to create more opportunities for students to approach the companies they are interested in and provide them good resources about job hunting. I&#039;d like to send out a survey about the companies that students are interested and work on that list: inviting these companies to come and give info session or offer field trip opportunities. I also would like hear from students about what career development service they are looking for, and then try to provide them any resources related, such as interview workshop.

Alumni affairs :- Since I have substantial experience with communicating with alumni and hosting events for them, I strongly believe that I would easily relate to them and help the engineering student body reach their successful alumni. At the same time I would like to contribute to better networking between students and their alumni via electronic media.

Career development :- I would like to think that career development is one of the most pressing issues that concern wide graduate engineering student body. Keeping that in mind, I would love to help to this committee plan customized events that are relevant to particular professional fields and students interested in them.

Budget :- I have participated in various appropriations committees both from the side of a student organization requesting funds and also as a voting member of a budget committee appropriating funds to more than 100 different student organizations. I have two-year experience with student funds management in student government. I would like to help student clubs reach appropriate funding for their events and actions and make sure that the appropriation process is simple and efficient.

I was a coordinator for my undergraduate university festival &amp;quot;Manzar&amp;quot; where I oversaw various events and planned the schedule. Throughout my undergraduate years I engaged in, debates, discussions and making presentations to my peers on topics like Integration of Industries, Production of Vinyl chloride Monomer, Passivation of stainless steel and health benefits by enzyme therapy. In my Internship in Bharat Petroleum (a fortune 500 company) I presented to the board a few safeguards the company should employ. The board was so impressed that they implemented it in their Mumbai factory. I also tutored underprivileged children Mathematics and English for a well known NGO in India called &amp;#039;Vidya&amp;#039;.

I am great with people and love working with them. In addition I am witty and smart(I got in Columbia right!) and working with me makes even dreary jobs fun. I am certain that if you select me I will contribute tremendously to these fields. Let me have a 10 minute interview if you are uncertain of me.
