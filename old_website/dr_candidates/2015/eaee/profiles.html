While an undergraduate at Duke University I coordinated my Fraternity (AEPI) Alumni network and organized socials. This experience helped me gain valuable skills that could certainly be applied to EGSC.

I think it's very important that Alumni maintain a strong relationship with their Alma Mater. By cultivating a robust Alumni community we can help current students to connect and learn from the experience of others. While working at the sales desk at Karbone (a renewable energy brokerage firm) I built a large industry network through a variety of outreach methods (cold calling, event planning, etc.). I'm confident I could offer these same abilities to EGSC

My experiences serving on the boards of multiple professional and academic organizations have equipped me with the skills to lead and implement inputs from members. As an employee at the International Renewable Energy Agency, I co-founded the staff-led Corporate Sustainability Group. In my role as a group leader, I marshaled support from upper management, successfully garnered funding and helped establish a process for evaluating sustainability pilot projects for dispersing funds. Engaging with co-workers and managers, evaluating projects and making budget decisions are all very relevant skills that prepare me to serve as a department representative.  

In addition, I have experience organizing and hosting professional events. I served on the core organizing team of the International Off-grid Renewable Energy Conference in Manila, Philippines, directly liaising with international energy experts and crafting session panels. Incorporating feedback and managing expectations of speakers and participants was a crucial part of my job that would prepare me well for event organization and student engagement as part of EGSC.

As a member of the Interschool committee, I would seek to further strengthen the cooperation between schools through innovative events, collaborative projects and joint communication to students. I am particularly dedicated to enhancing the interschool collaboration around entrepreneurship activities and opportunities through collaborative events across schools and broader entrepreneurship resource dissemination. I currently serve as a liaison of the Business School’s Lion’s Lab to entrepreneurship interests in the Columbia engineering community and would build on my relationships within the Business School to foster closer communication and engaging events. 

In the Budget Committee, I would aim to support student groups through the budget proposal process through requested resources and workshops. As a board member of IRENA’s Corporate Sustainability Team, I clearly communicated the budget proposal process for sustainability pilot projects and made opportunities for funding aware to other co-workers. I would like to bring these same skills in budget management and communication to my role within the Budget Committee.

If I were to join the Alumni Affairs Committee, I would strive to engage recent graduates in networking events and focus on providing opportunities for alumni to serve as mentors for students in their respective fields. While serving on the organizing team of the International Off-grid Renewable Energy Conference, I engaged with dozens of experts in energy engineering, finance, and policy and directed them to opportunities to participate in our conference. As a member of the Alumni Affairs Committee, I could bring the same skills in communication and engagement towards meaningfully interacting with alumni.
