Getting involved and taking part in the processes and changes in SEAS. I believe that EGSC is one of the most important arenas for promoting students’ interests. As an international student in SEAS I have a better understanding of the issues troubling most of the student body of SEAS.

I have been the coordinator during my my undergrad for college festival in 2013. I was involved in organizing technical events such as paper presentation, model presentation, sustainable development and non technical events like quiz, debates, etc. during the festival. I was an active member of the team that brought sponsorship for the festival.

I have also volunteered for Clean Up drive, AIDS awareness and immunization camp for educating poor people in my country.

Have been Class Representative in my High School for 3 years. Then, I've been member of "StudentIngegneria" Association at University of Salerno, a club helping students with any issue concerning the academical life. These experiences helped me develop leadership and organisational skills.

I think my committees of choice could match perfectly both my skills and interests and help me develop new ones. I'd like to work on the EGSC Facebook page, which I think should be improved to provide more students access to social events and participation.

I have done my Bachelors in Civil Engineering from VJTI, Mumbai, India followed by a work experience in Oberoi Realty Limited (ORL), Mumbai, India in the Engineering, Procurement and Construction team. 
I was involved in the Inter-college festival back in the undergrad as a Sports Co-ordinator and Event Head for many sports wherein I conducted the events, managed a team of 15 people in order to deliver to the expectations of the sportive audience.
At work in ORL, I was actively involved in the departmental affairs and conducted weekly meetings discussing technical, extra-curricular issues.

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
I want to volunteer in the social events organized by the organization. I look forward to keep the people updated and in full participation for all the events, thus making all of the students to not only excel academically but also develop  otherwise by nurturing their personal interests/hobbies and see themselves graduate being different personalities altogether, having developed innumerable friendships.

Lastly, I would be glad to help folks create memories for them to look back at the CU experience and feel proud about having lived life in the best way possible at CU.

My past experiences will make me get used to dealing with different kinds of people and come up with new ideas about how to offer better services for CU students. Meanwhile, I also hope I can improve my communication skills and make more good friends through this opportunity. This is why I focus more on social positions.

     <h4 class="team-member-name">Please describe any relevant past experience</h4>
I have been a class representative for 7 years (3 years in high school and 4 years during my undergraduate studies). During my undergraduate school was committed in numerous clubs and I have organized various events: social networking sessions, career fairs, and orientation week-ends for first years students as well as conferences for almost 650 students. I thus learnt how to properly manage my time and organize myself finding the right balance between my studies and my extra scholar activities. I have sharply increased my organizational and communication skills since I had to meet my classmates’ and the remaining students’ high expectations. I dealt with professionals as well as with my school’s administration and teachers. I learnt how to work while staying flexible and adapt myself to face and handle complex situations. My commitment towards different clubs was challenging since I refuse disappointing people and always aim at being as reliable as possible.  
I am extremely sensitive to one of my past experiences. I founded a humanitarian club in my engineering school in Paris called Hader ESTP. I created “Hader” as my pacific weapon against analphabetism, one of the biggest burdens of my native country, Morocco. Hader means « being present » in Arabic and at the very same time it is the homonymous of the French expression « to join someone or something ».
Founding Hader taught me that a team has an incredible amount of skills, knowledge and methods brought by all its members and there is no denying that a single individual can hardly ever reach those alone. Teamwork helps better manage project, encourages to go beyond limits and promotes stick-to-itveness and perseverance.
<br><br>

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
My first goal, no matter what committees I will be enrolled in, will be to make it as friendly, active and dynamic as possible. To do that, on one hand, I think that a great internal organization is needed. Members have to work together as a coordinated and solidary team. I consider that a committee is built as a team thus each member has a specific role and the coherence and coordination between all members is mandatory to achieve our common goals in the more enjoyable atmosphere possible. Being able to build friend relationship with the other members is more than essential to me. 
On the other hand, enhancing communication between committee’s will automatically have great impacts on the communication with the remaining Engineering Graduate Students. I am ready to spend a lot of time on the committee’s projects trying to make them as original and fulfilling as possible. I hope that my optimism and true commitment will have great and positive impacts on the committee’s choices. Indeed, no matter the team project I commit into I always work hard on bringing a positive attitude no matter the complexity of the situation is. It mandatory to me to have an enjoyable “work” spirit because it will influence, in a way or another, on our final results and goals. 
I want to contribute as far as possible to make these years at Columbia as enjoyable and unforgettable as possible for Graduate students.
As the alumni affairs committee is concerned, I hope that we will succeed in gathering as much as alumni for networking sessions. Organizing speed meetings and interview workshops. Moreover, planning company's visit could be interesting. Finally as the academic affairs is concerned, being able to discuss and questioned the core of the programs of the masters would be a great learning. Since I realized that master's program and functioning are extremely flexible and updated according to the real world, I would be honored to be attend meetings and be part of this great intellectual adventure.

     <h4 class="team-member-name">Any other information you would like to share</h4>
I am half Moroccan and half Lebanese, I grew up in Morocco and went to Paris for my undergraduate studies. As a young girl with strong ambition, my upbringing in a developing country such as Morocco was unconditionally a genuine teaching and source of inspiration. My Lebanese origins along with the opportunity I had to study in French schools since elementary school helped me forge myself enjoying a rich and multicultural education. It allows me adapt myself easily in different situations and accounts for my social abilities.
It hence enhanced my openmindness, inquisitiveness and most importantly my enthousiasm about others which have not decreased since then. Being constantly in contact with different cultures, traditions and mindsets helped me to strike a balance between all this diversity, to be tolerant and to find out how to make it a genuine strength. My wish to help and be useful to people that surround me drove me to commit in different experiences facing responsibilities and enhancing my leadership skills.
