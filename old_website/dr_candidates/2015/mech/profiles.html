- As part of the Alumni Affairs committee, I would like to help in creating opportunities that allow graduate engineering students to interact with recent alumni. I would also like to create a system where students can help in choosing people or company representatives that they are interested in talking to. 

-I believe that as a student it is very important to surround yourself with a variety of people, especially those with different educational backgrounds. Therefore, if I get the opportunity to be a part of the Interschool committee, I would like to work with Business School and SIPA to provide engineering students a platform to meet their counterparts in those schools.

-Having an engineering background opens up a lot of opportunities for us. But, sometimes, we don't have enough information about those opportunities to consider them seriously. As a part of the Career Development Committee, I would make efforts to make resources accessible that allow students to take more informed decisions regarding their career paths.

For two years, I organized a regional underwater robotics competition, run by the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center. My duties involved constructing the set that the competitors would interact with as well as overseeing the competition itself, by instructing judges and ensuring a smooth operation. Both years that I was in charge, competitors and judges alike noted the efficiency of the setup and the flawlessness nature of the competition's flow.
Also, I partook in many official parent and alumni "meet and greets" at my alma mater and am accustomed to interacting with working professionals and establishing relationships with said people. I enjoy striking up a conversation with a complete stranger and learning about their interests and career.

I want to make it easy for students to get involved and establish relationships with other students and alumni alike. So far, in my brief time here at Columbia, I have been slightly overwhelmed with both attempting to figure out career paths and just how to go about getting involved in the community. Since I have a track record of organizing efficient and successful events, I want to bring that experience to the EGSC here at Columbia. My plan would be to setup (or modify) modes of communication to easily spread the word about exciting ways to establish relationships with fellow Columbia members, both current students and alumni.

     <h4 class="team-member-name">Any other information you would like to share</h4>
Although I have never done this for an official organization, I have planned and organized social events on a budget. While at home or at school, I often lead the charge for events like "s'more night" or an annual summer reunion. The events always have an excellent turnout and all in attendance have a great time. I would love to bring my "unofficial" experience of hosting such events to Columbia.

During my senior year in undergrad I was an RA for a dorm where I was responsible for the well-being of 300 students - from freshmen to seniors. Part of that involved me being an unofficial representative to the university for the residents particularly when it came to residential concerns, but I also ensured people were informed of general academic and social resources that were available to them for a wide variety of issues; with 300 people to account for, I needed to stay informed about university policies and resources that would benefit a diverse group of people. 

As an RA, I also had the responsibility of organizing social events from a ski trip at Lake Tahoe to Food and Wine tour north of San Francisco. This involved budget negotiation with the university, logistical planning, and a lot of communication with the students to ensure things went as smoothly as possible. 

Perhaps more importantly was my involvement in the creation of culturally inclusive programming – something that I think is particularly relevant as a group of mechanical engineers from all backgrounds, genders, ethnic groups, and socioeconomic groups, we are a diverse community with a diverse set of needs. I hope that my background will allow me to work towards understanding the needs of the rest of the mechanical engineering graduate students so I can better represent our department in the EGSC.

As an undergraduate, I was fortunate enough to participate in research for several years and I got to know some graduate students fairly well learning a bit about what their experiences as grad students were like. I concede that the experiences of Stanford grad students are probably different than Columbia students; I at least got the sense of the general experience and the need for a different approach to graduate affairs from undergraduate.

Even though I didn’t serve on student council in college (I was the senior class vice president in high school), I am listing my experiences that I feel have given me skills that could be applied to a role in EGSC and I believe that I will be effective as a department representative. Ultimately, I believe my best qualification is my desire to be involved and represent my fellow Mechanical Engineers as best as I can.

The reason academic affairs are my top pick for committee is that I want to be able to ensure that students are being heard by the university and know that they have that ability. I've been an intermediary between students and a university before and I will be effective doing with academic affairs.

The career development committee is also of interest to me as somebody who eventually wants to have a career - preferably sometime soon. I want to make sure that mechanical engineers in particular are able to get in contact with alumni and find more career opportunities. I feel like this is something that will help everyone, while other functions might not be utilized by every student.

The social committee is another committee I would like to be involved with as somebody who wants there to be a community among the graduate students at Columbia - particularly in engineering. I think social events are a great way to bridge between departments as while we may get to know people in our classes or through our research, the best way to meet people and make connections outside our department is through inter-department socials, which I hope I can help keep people engaged in. Having organized social events as an RA, I feel that I can contribute to EGSC in this way as well.

In my undergrad I spearheaded the marketing activities for my college Mini Baja team managing to raise approximately 11,500 USD. Being the Vice-Captain, I had to manage a team of 30 individuals for the competition.

Additionally, I was a part of the events committee at Mercedes-Benz R&D, where I used to work before coming here. It included organizing food, venue and transport for the employees (170 approx.).

I think the Social committee is doing a great job and I've had a great time at the two socials (Carleton and The Cruise) that I've attended. My goal would be to encourage networking and socializing of attendees by including some activities during the social events. 

Alumni's are one of the best resources the current students should harness. They can provide significant insight to the real world outside; which would be a part of my vision for the EGSC. Making current students aware of the opportunities would also be one of the goals I would like to achieve during my time here.

I chose Digital Media because I would love to contribute my passion and knowledge to website and iOS app development. As my goal to help establish well rounded media tools and make more people get easy accesses to EGSC, I will use my previous club founding and company development experience. Media is one of the most important elements of any team to distribute organization spirits and information. I will do my best to make high efficient interfaces and improve members communication.

Before coming to Columbia I was an English teacher in Korea. In addition to helping others communicate in foreign language, I enjoyed the experience of promoting interaction among people from different backgrounds, whether they be cultural, professional, or otherwise. Recognizing the diversity in the graduate engineering student body, my goal is to apply these experiences as a department representative to encourage the participation and interactions of all graduate students, so that they are able to enjoy their time at Columbia and develop meaningful relationships and experiences.

I have thoroughly enjoyed the time in my undergraduate school as a member of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Collegiate Club, working with accomplished industrialists, experienced seniors and professors. I have worked under the Head of department as an organizer and team leader and have held various responsibilities such as the Creative Head, General Secretary and the President of SAE council. My responsibilities as the President of the council were to lead the team, and conduct weekly meetings for members and juniors and also to organize academic, professional, social and technical events like career development sessions, industrial visits, workshops & events at the university annual technical festivals. Working as the President, has inculcated in me a strong sense of responsibility, teamwork and leadership. It also helped me strengthen my bonds with peers and faculty members.

Apart from this, I have also been the National Student Coordinator for Industrial Skill Development Programs organized by IIT-Bombay where my responsibilities were to coordinate and negotiate with sponsors for event fundraising and also help publicize the event.

Along with these activities, I have also been the event head for various sports, cultural and technical events and was the marketing member for the college Baja team. To sum up, these experiences have been a veritable gold mine of knowledge and learning and I wish to achieve the same at Columbia.

The Alumni Affairs Committee and the Career Development Committee, I believe, have an abundance of opportunities for professionals now spread across various industries to share their experiences. I envision to bring alumnus and industry professionals in a closer knit, to encourage more communication and opportunities to promote meaningful engagement as well as strengthen the department's external relationships, programs, and resources. I aim to create an excellent database to keep the current positions updated and well maintained by organizing events that take into consideration group activities and fun games which would also help create a stronger sense of bonding and communication.
