I think that because the Data Science Institute is new, I want to work to begin incorporating feedback from the Alumni into the program so the program understands the challenges the students have been facing during school and in their careers/internships.

I want to also get involved in the career development goal and help to bring in companies related to Data Science by working with the Columbia Data Science Society and leveraging the networks within Columbia.

With an international background and 7 years of schooling and working in different cities in the US, I deeply understand the importance of building effective connections with people from different cultural and economical background. My major goal is to foster a more lively and helpful social environment in the school of engineering so that students can make the most out of their Columbia experience. I hope I can contribute in building stronger bonds between fellow student/alumni through organizing social and/or interschool events.

I led a team to participate in the MIT-CHINA Entrepreneurship Business Plan Contest and became one of seven finalists out of 130 teams globally as well as the web/IT track contest final winner. I contributed in coordinating team membersâ€™ efforts, solving conflicts, and ensuring quality deliverables under tight deadlines.
