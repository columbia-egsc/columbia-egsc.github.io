As an undergraduate at the University of Delaware, I was a member of Delta Tau Delta and the engineering honor society Tau Beta Pi. I held several administrative positions including Greek Week chair, Social chair, and ROAD chair, a position unique to my fraternity focused on personal development. I also held an executive board position as Secretary where I helped implement efficient and modern means of mass communication that the fraternity still utilizes today.

I have plenty of other leadership experience in addition to the roles in my social organizations. From 2011-2012, I managed a political campaign for a State Senate seat in Delaware for a candidate named Bryan Townsend who recently announced he is going to run for Delaware's lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. This opportunity gave me great experience in planning events, organizing resources and human capital, developing fundraising initiatives, and understanding people of all different backgrounds while knocking on doors day in and day out promoting my candidate.

I feel that I have all the necessary qualifications and experience to work on a multitude of committees. I am thankful for the opportunity to work with EGSC and its associates on making life even better for graduate students.

I have always been very good at speaking and dealing with people who are older and with more general life experience than myself. I would be a great addition to the alumni affairs committee because I have no qualms with reaching out to people I have never met before and asking for assistance whether it be for fundraising or organizing an alumni Tech Talk on campus to help graduating students find direction with their next steps in life. I can be a motivating and enthusing spokesperson for the committee if needed or sit and lick envelopes if that's how I am the most useful.

I have served my department since my first year as Career Chair, then Vice President, and President of the Graduate BME Council, with responsibilities ranging from event planning to running meetings and coordinating with faculty on interview weekend and orientation.  I served on the executive committee of TEDxColumbiaEngineering as the Marketing and Promotions Chair alongside graduate students from across SEAS.  I have regularly attended EGSC meetings for the past year and volunteered in the Interschool Committee, as well as filling the role of this committee's chair over the summer by leading the planning committee for FestiFall.
<br><br>

     <h4 class="team-member-name">What are your goals/vision for your committees of choice? How do you think you can contribute to them?</h4>
As a member of the planning committee for FestiFall, I would like to see the Columbia Graduate Council's activities expand beyond this annual social to offer other opportunities for schools across campus to come together in planning and enjoying an event.  Continuity in leadership is always a challenge in the face of the rapid turnover of masters students, so I would like to develop a better framework for planning interschool events that is easy for new members to pick up and run with.  I have great organizational skills, as well as contacts in many schools around campus, which will aid in strengthening the transition between active CGC members and interschool relations in general.
  I have done a fair amount of event planning, but often within the student body, and have not gotten a chance to really acquaint myself with the alumni community and how they can function as a resource.  I would like to add my creativity and organizational skills to planning new types of events where students can not only meet alumni, but benefit from the meeting in a way that does not feel forced.
  I would also welcome a change from the usual event planning and work in Academic Affairs.  I have excellent communication skills, which I think would be helpful in facilitating the conversations that must happen across student and administrative populations to make meaningful policy change.

I have been coming to EGSC meetings regularly for the past year, I just haven't been able to come to enough consecutively to make an impression, as I was busy running own department's graduate student council.  I have passed this responsibility onto the newer students and am now looking forward to focusing my extracurricular time on EGSC.
