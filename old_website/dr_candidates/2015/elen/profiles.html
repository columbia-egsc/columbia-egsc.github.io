-I was part of the Latin American Optics and Photonics Conference 2014 organizing committee in Cancun, Mexico.

During my undergrad I participated as the:
-Nanotechnology and Science Communication club where we organized talks and workshops. During this time I also hosted a science communication radio show. (three years)
-Make Do-It-Yourself club (one year)

As a first year graduate student, I was exposed to a plethora of social activities on campus. The socials were well organized and gave me a chance to interact with students across the SEAS and different schools. 

I am a Phd student in the department of Electrical Engineering. Great as many socials were, I hardly saw a social or a happy hour in my department, where students across various years were allowed to interact and participate. Its great to concentrate on conducting socials for new comers (believe me, we needed it and we felt a part of the community), but there was a lack of interaction with our seniors. I would like to conduct more socials back in my department and also in the graduate school where students across various years can participate and discuss their work.

SEAS can organize a social coffee hour for all MS and Phd students once a month or across different schools to come and interact. This helps us not only in interacting on a personal level, but also leads to an exchange of ideas.

I aspire to improve the scenario of the career development by addressing the practicalities being involved. Its a general trend that EE companies are under represented in job fairs due to the geographical location. However, I believe that we can try to establish an online portal and ask companies to participate in the online sessions and bridge the existent gap.
I have good experience working with various groups during my undergrad and played key role in establishing and nurturing relations with various companies from the industry by aiding the events and stuff.

Social interactions help develop interpersonal skills and make one mentally sound and strong. As for our department it is very essential that the students of the department get to network and develop as an over-all personality. It is role of the department committee to ensure such interactions are at a plentiful, so that the students can make the most out of it. 
I have studied in various places and met many different kinds of people. This has helped me understand and interact with people very easily.

I'm an articulate and highly motivated graduate student accustomed to working under pressure and using own initiative. So,

For the administrative committee:
Continue the good work and find means of utilizing the budget in a more concise manner as well as try to engage more students in EGSC activities! I will also try to add more career related events with help from CCE as well as organize events(maybe online) where alumni or seniors could simply answer the common queries of students

For the Digital Media Committee:
Improve the coverage of events and publicize it via Eventbrite or other social media platforms at least a week in advance so that maximum students are aware about it

For the Social Committee:
While managing the current schedule of events,I could incorporate more events such as inter association/group competitions. For instance, tug-of-war competition between ISAC ,CSC,AAA and other allied groups. That will help break the ice between students.

I was the captain of my department's soccer team in undergraduate.
During my 2 years' serve as the captain, I was mainly responsible for training, evaluating, and organizing matches for the soccer team. I gained some administrative experiences at that time. But more importantly, I learned how every individual's idea values and how to build a big family as the captain.

I attended the EGSC board meeting on 25th September. However, I didn't see a lot of Chinese students on the Board. That was a big surprise for me because the Chinese may be the biggest group in SEAS (even more Chinese students than the US students) while the proportion we are in the EGSC is so little. This is an example that Chinese students are not involved well in the whole SEAS community. My vision is to help Chinese students in EE communicate more with the students from other countries and promote the culture interlace between the West and East. I think I can contribute to this goal by serving as the link between Chinese students and other students.

Besides, in order to share our life with foreign students in out university, I organized the party for foreign exchange students with other students. We invite them into our home, cooking together and talking with others.

I want to learn more about the graduates' career development, and help other new comers of columbia, especially who want to find job after graduate, have more idea about their resume and their future career.

I have taken career development course in university. I think I have some basic ideas about the career development, which I think can be shared with other people's in EGSC.

I believe that books and classes can only get a student so far. The network built during his/her experience here will be the most important resource. Nevertheless, alumni relations often feel like a one-way process, in which the alumni are always asked to give, and the students are always the ones to receive. A successful and sustainable relationship in alumni affairs should be bilateral and mutually beneficial. I plan on improving the marketability of the students to the alumni and in return develop a stronger alumni-student relationship.

Alumni affairs: organize outreach events smoothly and helpful for students.

Personally well organized and enjoying planning and organizing events.

Career development: give SEAS students more opportunities to get career advice from CCE, alumni as well as career fairs.

Very familiar with resources CCE offers as well as Lionshare. Also been to a fair share of info sessions, career development lectures. Familiar with what Columbia has to offer in terms of networking.

Academic affairs: put students with questions, regarding course registration, academic resources and so on, into the right hands of either department academic advisor or specific professor.

Consulted with Elsa(academic advisor) a few times. Familiar with the process and what Columbia could do for students with different academic requirements.
