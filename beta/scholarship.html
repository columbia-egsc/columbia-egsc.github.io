					<h2>Program Description</h2>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">In keeping with the highest ideals of the EGSC, the Professional Development Scholarship Program is awarded to outstanding graduate students in The Columbia University Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS) as a means of defraying costs associated with their academic and professional endeavors. Past recipients have used the Scholarship to fund memberships to professional societies and the cost of attending academic conferences. In addition to a monetary award, EGSC Professional Development Scholars are provided a platform from which to disseminate their knowledge and expertise, thereby impacting the larger SEAS community.</p>
					<h2>Eligibility</h2>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">This award carries no citizenship requirements. Eligible recipients must be current graduate students (M.S., Ph.D., or M.S. leading to Ph.D.) enrolled full-time and in good academic standing. Special consideration may be given to applicants who demonstrate financial need and/or show evidence of self-support. Current members of the EGSC Executive Board and the University Senator are NOT eligible to receive funding during their tenure.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Applicants are limited to one application per academic year. Winning applicants are not eligible to receive a similar scholarship in subsequent years. Students whose applications are not selected to receive funding are eligible to apply in subsequent years, although resubmission of identical applications is discouraged. Applicants found to be submitting expenses in duplicate to other funding programs for reimbursement may be disqualified, and no longer eligible for funding in subsequent years. </p>
					<h2>Anticipated Award Amount</h2>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Applicants may request up to $1000 per application.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Unused funds are non-transferrable and may not be used for expenses unrelated to those explicitly stated in the application. Please note that original itemized receipts and proof of acceptance/attendance (if applicable) are required in order to be eligible for reimbursement.</p>
					<h2>Application</h2>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Find the application form <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Completed applications must include: (1) EGSC Scholarship Application Form, (2) Student Scholar Statement, and (3) Curriculum Vitae. For conference or summer school travel, applicants should additionally include confirmation of acceptance into the program.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The Student Scholar Statement should address all of the following points:</p>
					<ul style="list-style-type: disc; text-align: justify;">
						<li>the intended use of the scholarship award (i.e. the specific fees to be reimbursed)</li>
						<li>the intellectual merit of the knowledge or experience the applicant will gain on a personal level via the scholarship</li>
						<li>the manner in which the acquired knowledge or experience will be disseminated by the applicant to the greater SEAS community</li>
						<li>the intellectual merit and broader impact of the knowledge or experience to be relayed to the greater SEAS community</li>
					</ul>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">The statement should be written on standard 8.5" x 11" page size, with 12-point Times New Roman font, 1" margins, and single line spacing. The statement should not exceed two pages.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Please note: reimbursement of expenses detailed in the application will only be provided upon successful dissemination of knowledge to the SEAS community.</p>
					<h2>Application Deadline</h2>
					<h3><strong>Spring 2016 Application Deadline - March 4, 2016 (5:00 PM EST)</strong></h3>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Applications should be submitted in anticipation of upcoming expenses as the award is distributed through reimbursement. Only under exceptional circumstances may applications be considered for expenses already incurred, and such determinations will be made at the discretion of the EGSC Executive Committee. For expenses occurring January 1st through May 31st, applications should be submitted by the Spring funding deadline. For expenses occurring June 1st through August 31st, applications should be submitted by the Summer funding deadline. For expenses occurring September 1st through December 31st, applications should be submitted by the Fall funding deadline.</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">All applications must be complete and submitted to the EGSC treasurer (<a href="mailto:treasurer@egsc.seas.columbia.edu">treasurer@egsc.seas.columbia.edu</a>) by the appropriate deadline to be considered. Any further questions can be directed to the EGSC treasurer. Incomplete applications will not be considered.</p>
					<h2>Evaluation</h2>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">Submitted applications are subject to initial review by the EGSC Executive Board and all general council members. Final selections will be made by a Review Panel consisting of 5 members, with at least one representative from each of the following governing bodies at SEAS: the <span style="font-style: italic;">Dean's Office</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">Office of Graduate Student Affairs</span>, and the <span style="font-style: italic;">EGSC Executive Board</span>. Winning applicants will be notified via email within two weeks of the application deadline. EGSC will not contact applicants who were not chosen to receive funding.</p>
					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					<h4><strong>Q: I am a first year Masters student. How do I prove that I am in good academic standing?</strong></h4>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">A: Engineering students who are in their first semester of graduate school may still apply; however, qualifying applicants will be selected for the award on a conditional basis. Reimbursement will only be approved following the release of grades from their first semester, demonstrating good academic standing.</p>
					<h4><strong>Q: Can I use this scholarship to buy research equipment (i.e. computers, iPads, etc.)?</strong></h4>
					<p style="text-align: justify;">A: Although we understand that a lack of material resources may place constraints on our students, this scholarship is intended to fund academic and/or professional opportunities beyond those typically pursued in the course of graduate study, that would be otherwise inaccessible due to financial hardship. In addition, this scholarship fund targets student endeavors that will have a broader impact on the SEAS community. Equipment that is necessary for the completion of degree requirements or research experiments should be provided by your department or faculty advisor, regardless of funding status.</p>
