Become LEED Accredited! <br>
                              <br>
When: February 14th 2015 - 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM<br>
Where: CCNY - Mechanical Engineering Building &#8211; Exhibition Room - http://goo.gl/maps/oJ3lG<br>
Registration: http://leadinggreen.ca/NYC<br>
Interested in getting involved in the Green Building Industry?
Opportunities are plentiful in the field of sustainable design and LEED
is at its forefront.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is simply a
green-rating point system, or a scorecard. The more energy efficient
and sustainable a building is, the more points it will earn. To date,
this course and its materials have proven to be instrumental in helping
over 1500 students pass their respective exam at a 100% pass rate. This
course is offered at a quarter of the price and time as the competition
and is geared at allowing students to graduate with letters after their
name!<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Just as Buildings can be LEED certified, people in the sustainable
construction industry can become LEED Professionals. The LEED Green
Associate (GA) credential is the only entry level sustainability
designation and shows employers and clients that you have certified
knowledge in the green building industry.&nbsp; A new LEED rating
system (v4) was introduced last month and this training course is one
of the few that has been updated to teach the current rating system.
This course meets the exam&#8217;s eligibility requirements and the USGBC
charges a $200 fee for the actual exam which can be taken at any time
at your nearest Prometric center.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Cost: $300 ($200 for full time students)<br>
