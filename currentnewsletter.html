Got awesome data you want to display? Interested in, but never got
around to learning how to make awesome visualizations for the web? Come
to this 2-day workshop to get a taste of D3.js - a powerful JavaScript
library used to bring data to life. The first night will be an
introduction to D3.js: how to approach and use the library. It assumes
very basic HTML / CSS knowledge, and zero prior knowledge about D3.js.
The second night will be a continuation of the previous night's
workshop: more advanced D3.js techniques will be discussed and covered.
