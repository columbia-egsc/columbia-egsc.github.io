                              <h4>PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:</h4>

In keeping with the highest ideals of the EGSC, the Professional
Development Scholarship Program is awarded to outstanding graduate
students in The Columbia University Fu Foundation School of Engineering
and Applied Sciences (SEAS) as a means of defraying costs associated
with their academic and professional endeavors. In addition to a
monetary award, EGSC Professional Development Scholars are provided a
platform from which to disseminate their knowledge and expertise,
thereby impacting the larger SEAS community. <br>
                              
                              <h4>ELIGIBILITY:</h4>

This award carries no citizenship requirements. Eligible recipients
must be current graduate students (M.S., Ph.D., or M.S. leading to
Ph.D.) enrolled full-time and in good academic standing. Special

Executive Board and the University Senator are NOT eligible to receive
funding during their tenure. <br>
                              <br>
Applicants are limited to one application per academic year, and
resubmission of identical applications is discouraged. Awardees are not
eligible to re-apply in subsequent years. Students found to be
requesting reimbursement in duplicate to other funding programs will be
stripped of the Scholar title, removed from consideration, and no
longer eligible for funding in subsequent years. <br>
