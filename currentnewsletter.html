EGSC and the Office of Graduate Student Affairs will be launching a
campaign titled "Where Will SEAS Take You?" starting now and will end
November 14, 2014. The goal is to showcase how SEAS students are
changing lives and changing the world around them. <br>
                        <br>
We are asking SEAS students and alumni to post pictures taken around
the world (NYC as well) that display the official Columbia Engineering
backpack. <br>
                        <br>
Please post photos with the hashtag of #seastravels on the following:<br>

many of his firsthand experiences founding and running four companies:
the product design process, bootstrapping, raising money (from angels,
venture capitalists, and kickstarter), intellectual property
protection, employing people, overseas manufacturing, importing,
exporting, marketing, suing, being sued, etc., in hopes of helping you
decide if you, too, should become a captain of industry.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">

                              <span style="font-weight: normal;">Bio: Michael Larson earned his PhD
from MIT in 1992. He now holds the El Pomar Endowed Chair of
Engineering and Innovation and is a Professor of Mechanical Engineering
at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. In addition to his
academic teaching and basic research, Michael has co-founded four
companies: two businesses based on medical devices he has invented (one
a laser-based surgical tool for closing wounds), one business built on
a laser board game called Khet, and one, Mind Rocket, created to
develop a suite of consumer products. The first of these products is an
all-natural, drug-free device to help people sleep better. His passion
for entrepreneurship and innovation has been recognized by numerous
awards, including New Orleans' City Business magazine naming him
"Entrepreneur of the Year&#8221; in 2005 for founding and directing a studio
for creative design. </span><br style="font-weight: normal;">

                              <span style="font-weight: normal;">Dr. Larson has conducted numerous
workshops on the topics of innovation and creative problem solving and
has garnered six awards for outstanding teaching. Dr. Larson has
received over $7M from a variety of agencies, including the NSF, the
U.S. Air Force, the Missile Defense Agency, and private corporations,
for a variety of research initiatives from the fracture and failure of
materials to optical methods. His current research focus is on
laser/materials interactions, especially related to medical
applications. He has also provided engineering consulting and design
services for many clients, including serving as a product design and
failure analysis expert in seven legal cases. He has piloted a jet
aircraft, steered a nuclear submarine, and can wiggle his ears. One at
a time.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">

When: November 22nd 2014 - 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM<br>
Where: CCNY - Mechanical Engineering Building &#8211; Exhibition Room - http://goo.gl/maps/oJ3lG<br>
Registration: http://leadinggreen.ca/NYCity<br>
Interested in getting involved in the Green Building Industry?
Opportunities are plentiful in the field of sustainable design and LEED
is at its forefront.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is simply a
green-rating point system, or a scorecard. The more energy efficient
and sustainable a building is, the more points it will earn. To date,
this course and its materials have proven to be instrumental in helping
over 1500 students pass their respective exam at a 100% pass rate. This
course is offered at a quarter of the price and time as the competition
and is geared at allowing students to graduate with letters after their
name!<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Just as Buildings can be LEED certified, people in the sustainable
construction industry can become LEED Professionals. The LEED Green
Associate (GA) credential is the only entry level sustainability
designation and shows employers and clients that you have certified
knowledge in the green building industry.&nbsp; A new LEED rating
system (v4) was introduced last month and this training course is one
of the few that has been updated to teach the current rating system.
This course meets the exam&#8217;s eligibility requirements and the USGBC
charges a $200 fee for the actual exam which can be taken at any time
at your nearest Prometric center.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Cost: $300 ($200 for full time students)<br>
