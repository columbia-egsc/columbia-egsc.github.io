                              <h3>"Modern Optimization Meets Physics: Recent Progress on Phase Retrieval"</h3>
In many imaging problems such as X-ray crystallography, detectors can
only record the intensity or magnitude of a diffracted wave as opposed
to measuring its phase. Phase retrieval concerns the recovery of an
image from such phaseless information. This problem is of great
importance because it arises in many applications ranging from
astronomical imaging to speech analysis. This talks discusses novel
acquisition strategies and novel convex and non-convex algorithms which
are provably exact allowing perfect phase recovery from a minimal
number of noiseless intensity-only measurements. More importantly, we
also demonstrate that our noise-aware algorithms are stable in the
sense that the reconstruction degrades gracefully as the
signal-to-noise ratio decreases. This may be of special contemporary
interest because phase retrieval is at the center of spectacular
current research efforts collectively known under the name of coherent
diffraction imaging aimed, among other things, at determining the 3D
structure of large protein complexes.<br>

Abstract:<br>
The Web has enabled the availability of a huge amount of useful
information and people have come to rely on it to fulfill their
information needs in a variety of domains. We present a study on the
accuracy of data and the quality of Web sources in two domains where
quality is important to people's lives: Stock and Flight. We observe
that, even in these domains, the quality of the data is less than
ideal, with sources providing conflicting, out-of-date and incomplete
data. Sources also copy and reformat data from other sources, making it
difficult to discover the truth. We describe principled techniques to
begin solving these problems, and guide us in search of truth on the
Web.<br>

Title: Using a Market Simulator to Develop Execution Algorithms<br>
Abstract: <br>
A market simulator is an essential tool for the development of
high-frequency trading strategies. Many trading shops have such a tool,
but the details are rarely presented publically. We will present the
principles of constructing a simulator with especial emphasis on
interest rates futures products, taking account of the special features
of these markets such as pro rata matching, implied liquidity, and
pricing signals. Comparison with actual trade executions lets us make a
quantitative assessment of the validity of the simulator across a range
of futures products.<br>

Title: Optimization of Industrial-Scale Assemble to Order Systems<br>
Co-author: Willem van Jaarsveld, Erasmus University Rotterdam<br>
                              <br>
Abstract: Using a novel stochastic programming (SP) formulation, we
develop an algorithm for inventory control in industrial sized
Assemble-To-Order (ATO) systems that has unparalleled efficiency and
scalability. Applying our algorithm on several numerical examples, we
generate new insights with respect to the control and<br>
optimization of these systems.<br>
We consider a continuous time model, seeking base-stock levels for
components that minimize the sum of holding costs and product-specific
backorder costs. Our initial focus is on first-come first-serve (FCFS)
allocation of components to products; for this setting our algorithm
quickly computes solutions for which the asymptotic optimality gap with
the optimal FCFS base-stock policy is less than 1%. We then turn to two
related questions: How do common heuristics used in practice compare to
our performance, and how costly is the FCFS assumption.<br>
For the first question, we investigate the effectiveness of ignoring
simultaneous stockouts (ISS), a heuristic that has been used by
companies such as IBM and Dell. Our experiments indicate that ISS
performance, when compared to the optimal FCFS base-stock policy,
improves as the average newsvendor (NV) fractiles increase, but suffers
under lead time demand correlations.<br>
For the second question, we adapt the SP formulation of Dogru et al.
(2010), yielding an efficiently computable upper bound on the benefit
of optimal allocation over FCFS. We find that for many large ATO
systems, FCFS performs surprisingly well, and that its performance
improves with decreasing NV fractile asymmetry among products and,
again, with increasing average NV fractiles. We also investigate simple
no-holdback allocation policies, and find that they tend to outperform
the best FCFS policies. <br>

Title: Airplane boarding, express lines, modular symmetries, lenses, soap bubbles and more. <br>
                              <br>
Abstract: Airplane boarding is an operations research problem with high
customer visibility. OR departments and management in airlines
constantly experiment with boarding policies in an attempt to optimize
the procedure. Recently, a couple of airlines experimented with the
boarding policy which allows priority boarding to passengers with no
carry on luggage to be placed in the overhead bins. We will try to
analyze this policy. The policy is somewhat reminiscent of express line
queues in supermarkets which also attempt to separate "fast" from
"slow" ones. We note however that the analysis of express lines shares
nothing with the analysis of airplane boarding which is based on
Lorentzian (space-time) geometry. In this superficial analogy, the
service time distribution at the supermarket counter is analogous to
the aisle clearing time of a passenger in airplane boarding. We show
that the effect of the distribution on express line queues is
approximately the square of the (local) effect on airplane boarding.
This means that we can transport the large body of work on express line
queues to obtain approximation results on airplane boarding. In
particular, there is a modular symmetry on distributions which
preserves the effect on express line queues and roughly on airplane
boarding as well. Regarding the question of who should go first, the
slow or fast passengers, it turns out not to matter much. The optimal
solution is related to the construction of thin lenses centered around
soap bubbles in space-time geometry. <br>

Abstract<br>
                              <br>
Over the past several years, the stunning growth of the Cloud has
changed literally everything in networking.&nbsp;&nbsp; At Microsoft,
we have developed and deployed totally new network infrastructure to
handle the scale and agility of cloud services, creating virtual
networks that on shared infrastructure behave as if dedicated to
individual customers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will discuss the problems and the
approach to the solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp; A takeaway is that the action in
Software Defined Networking (SDN) is in the host.<br>

Approximately 80% of all jobs are found through some form of networking
and referrals.&nbsp; Through networking you make useful contacts, and
also gain knowledge and inside information about jobs and
organizations.&nbsp; You will learn how to handle and utilize different
networking situations such as Career Fairs, Information Sessions, and
LinkedIn groups. You will also have the opportunity to practice your
elevator pitch and conduct an informational interview. (This is the
