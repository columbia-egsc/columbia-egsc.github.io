Interested in getting involved in the Green Building Industry?
Opportunities are plentiful in the field of sustainable design and LEED
is at its forefront.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is simply a
green-rating point system, or a scorecard. The more energy efficient
and sustainable a building is, the more points it will earn. To date,
this course and its materials have proven to be instrumental in helping
over 1500 students pass their respective exam at a 100% pass rate. This
course is offered at a quarter of the price and time as the competition
and is geared at allowing students to graduate with letters after their
name!<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Just as Buildings can be LEED certified, people in the sustainable
construction industry can become LEED Professionals. The LEED Green
Associate (GA) credential is the only entry level sustainability
designation and shows employers and clients that you have certified
knowledge in the green building industry.&nbsp; A new LEED rating
system (v4) was introduced last month and this training course is one
of the few that has been updated to teach the current rating system.
This course meets the exam&#8217;s eligibility requirements and the USGBC
charges a $200 fee for the actual exam which can be taken at any time
at your nearest Prometric center.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Cost: $300 ($200 for full time students)<br>

Abstract:<br>
Kevin will provide a quick history of how the open source movement
began, what it has meant for software development, and more
importantly, what it has meant for other areas of knowledge gathering
and development. He will also talk about how students can find ways to
get involved in the global open source effort, and how such involvement
can provide benefits when looking for employment in technology
disciplines. Event open to all.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Kevin will also highlight an upcoming collaborative graduate student
event between Bloomberg and the Institute for Data Sciences and
Engineering: Open Source Day on Saturday, September 27th, 2014.&nbsp;
