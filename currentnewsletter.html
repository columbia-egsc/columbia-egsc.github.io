                        </p><big><span style="color: white;">As
part of the School's 150th anniversary celebration, Dean Boyce has
announced a video contest for students with a top prize of <big><span style="font-weight: bold; background-color: black; color: rgb(51, 255, 51);">$2,000</span> </big>for the winning video.<br>
                        <br>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Topic</span>:
The video should capture the significant impacts of engineering in
shaping our world over the past 100 or so years and its promise and
envisioned impacts to continue to revolutionize our world and our lives
over the coming decades. It would be great to focus on Columbia
Engineering but that is not a requirement.&nbsp; <br>
                        <br>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Video format</span>:
The format is totally open &#8211; you can include photos, sketches,
animations, movies, words, music, voice overs, people, processes,
artifacts, things...use your imagination! Videos may be done by
individuals or groups, undergrads or grads or combinations of both!<br>
                        <br>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Length</span>: Between 1½ and 2½ minutes<br>
                        <br>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Deadline</span>: Monday, November 3, at 12 noon<br>
                        <br>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Judging</span>:
ESC and EGSC leadership will consider the entire field of videos and
select 5 top entries. Those entries will be submitted to the dean and a
faculty panel for review, and following that process, the final winner
will be selected by the students via online voting.<br>
                        <br>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Prize</span>:
$2,000 for the winning undergraduate video and $2000 for the winning
graduate video. The winning videos will be shown on Friday, November 14
during the 150th anniversary symposium and will be featured on the
School's home page and 150th website.<br>
                        <br>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Eligibility</span>: All undergraduate and graduate students in SEAS (teams may have one member from another University school).<br>
                        <br style="font-weight: bold;">
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Model videos</span>: The National Academy of Engineering held a similar contest. Here is a <a style="color: rgb(102, 255, 255);" href="http://www.nae.edu/e4u/">link</a> to their winning videos, but please use your own imagination for your video!<br>
                        <br>
                        <span style="font-weight: bold;">Submission: </span>Teams
having a majority of graduate students should submit their videos to
videos@egsc.seas.columbia.edu. The videos should be of atleast 720p
resolution. Any questions can be directed to
nikul@egsc.seas.columbia.edu<br>
                        <br>
                        <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51);"></span>EGSC will be holding some intro workshops on video editing soon to help interested students. Stay tuned!<br>

                              <h3>EGSC Professional Development Scholarship</h3>
In keeping with the highest ideals of the EGSC, the Professional
Development Scholarship Program is awarded to outstanding graduate
students in The Columbia University Fu Foundation School of Engineering
and Applied Sciences (SEAS) as a means of defraying costs associated
with their academic and professional endeavors. In addition to a
monetary award, EGSC Professional Development Scholars are provided a
platform from which to disseminate their knowledge and expertise,
thereby impacting the larger SEAS community. <br>
                              <br>
This award carries no citizenship requirements. Eligible recipients
must be current graduate students (M.S., Ph.D., or M.S. leading to
Ph.D.) enrolled full-time and in good academic standing. Special
consideration may be given to applicants who demonstrate financial need
and/or show evidence of self-support. Current members of the EGSC
Executive Board and the University Senator are NOT eligible to receive
funding during their tenure. <br>
                              <br>
Applicants are limited to one application per academic year, and
resubmission of identical applications is discouraged. Awardees are not
eligible to re-apply in subsequent years. Students found to be
requesting reimbursement in duplicate to other funding programs will be
stripped of the Scholar title, removed from consideration, and no
longer eligible for funding in subsequent years. <br>
                              <br>
Applicants may request up to $1000 per application. <br>
                              <br>
Unused funds are non-transferrable and may not be used for expenses
unrelated to those explicitly stated in the application. Please note
that original itemized receipts and proof of acceptance/attendance (if
applicable) are required in order to be eligible for reimbursement. <br>

                              <br>
Strategy&amp; (Formerly Booz &amp; Company) cordially invites Master of
Engineering students who have an interest in the Middle East region to
join us and be a part of a Networking Reception with Joe Saddi -
Chairman of the Board, Middle East Senior Vice President<br>
Strategy&amp; is the new brand for Booz &amp; Company, the dominant
premium consulting firm in the Middle East that introduced the
profession to the region over two decades ago. Strategy&amp; inherits
Booz &amp; Company&#8217;s brand values of integrity and complete commitment
to helping our clients excel. As a separate line of business within the
PwC network, we are bigger, broader, and better than anyone else at
connecting strategy to impact.<br>
Strategy&amp;&#8217;s history in the Middle East is powerful. Since the 1993
launch of its operations in the region, the firm has established an
impressive record, with its commitment to top-quality service and
investment in talented staff. Today, more than 400 employees serve
clients across the entire Middle East region from six regional offices:
Abu Dhabi, Beirut, Cairo, Doha, Dubai and Riyadh.<br>
We&#8217;ve always been known as practical strategists who roll up our
sleeves to help clients get the job done. We&#8217;ve distilled an approach
to strategy based on 100 years of management advice that starts with
the premise that a few differentiating capabilities drive identity and
success. We help our clients identify and build those capabilities,
develop strategies based on them, and deliver value by executing those
strategies well. Now backed by the strength and scale of the PwC
network, we are driving even greater impact.<br>
Build an extraordinary career and help to change the consulting
landscape as we become the world&#8217;s pre-eminent
strategy-through-execution firm.<br>
We are seeking brilliant students at the graduate levels in the
Engineering Program to join our Middle East offices and work with us to
help our clients achieve their most challenging goals. We look for
candidates who are creative thinkers, bold and unafraid, driven by a
passion to help our clients achieve excellence. From our candidates, we
expect strong analytics and reasoning, along with the energy and
perseverance to relentlessly pursue creative solutions to complex
issues and then to be able to clearly communicate these ideas in a team
setting.<br>

                              <h1><a name="chat"></a>President Bollinger's Fireside Chat</h1>
President Bollinger holds Fireside Chats during each term to give
students an informal venue to engage with him and ask questions about
the University, administration, student life, and other topics. This
semester, President Bollinger will be holding the Fireside Chat for
graduate students on November 10th, 2014 from 6:00PM &#8211; 7:30PM at the
President&#8217;s House, 60 Morningside Drive at 116th Street.<br>
                              <br>
President Bollinger is inviting each graduate school to send a number
of students based on the school&#8217;s proportion of overall graduate
student enrollment.<br>
Eleven (11) SEAS graduate students will have the opportunity to
attend.&nbsp; Given the limited number of slots for this event,
students will be selected through a lottery system to ensure
fairness.&nbsp; If you would like to be considered for this event,
please register your information here:
https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/FiresideFall2014.&nbsp; Students
selected from this lottery will be asked to submit questions in advance
to be sent to President Bollinger.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The lottery will take place on Friday, October 24, 2014.&nbsp;
Registration for the lottery will close Thursday, October 23, 2014 at
midnight.<br>
