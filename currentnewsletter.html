                              <br>
This talk explains how we can use social media and the power of big
crowds to upgrade our brains, our thinking, and our lives. Mindsharing
shows us how to use technology to tap into a collective wisdom that has
the power to transform every aspect of our life from finance to romance
to family to career.<br>
From the prospective of a leading crowd wisdom researcher, author, a
former Microsoft vice president and a passionate speaker, Lior Zoref
will inspire you to think about the future of thinking in the era of
social networks and crowd wisdom. <br>
If the old saying is true that two brains are better than one, get
ready to benefit from the power of fifty, five hundred, or five
thousand brains. <br>

</h3>Top companies are hiring data scientists and engineers to help
find insights in the petabytes of data that they collect every day.
Scientists and engineers with research backgrounds in physics,
astronomy, computational biology, neuroscience, math, statistics,
computer science, and other quantitative fields are playing key roles
in transforming the way these companies work with data to impact our
daily lives.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Yan Kou, Kevin Mercurio, and Genevieve Smith, Insight Program
Directors, will be leading a discussion and Q&amp;A on careers in data
science and data engineering.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We will provide a high-level overview of data science in technology,
health, media, and non-profits. The session will include time for
Q&amp;A, as well as advice for those interested in transitioning to
careers in data science and data engineering.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The Insight Fellows Program is a free training fellowship for graduate
students and postdocs designed to bridge the gap between academia and a
career in data science and engineering. Insight provides seven-week,
full-time, postdoctoral training fellowships in New York City, Boston,
and Silicon Valley. They offer a full-tuition scholarship, dedicated
office space, and self-directed, project-based learning under the
guidance of top industry mentors. The first session focused
