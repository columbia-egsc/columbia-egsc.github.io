00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.800
There are two types of citations,
direct, and indirect.

2
00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.110
Both require proper
documentation when being cited.

3
00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.740
Direct citations take a phrase,
sentence, or sentences word for

4
00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:13.699
word from another work.

5
00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.800
This can also include taking tables or

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.940
other graphics unchanged
from somewhere else.

7
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.440
Direct quotations should be written within
quotation marks, or set as a block quote,

8
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.389
depending on the length of the quote and
the citation style you are using.

9
00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.070
Indirect citations,
may involve summarizing a full article,

10
00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.460
paraphrasing certain ideas
from another article, or

11
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.580
using previously gathered data to
create your own tables or graphics.

12
00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.880
These are just a few examples of
direct and indirect citations.

13
00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.850
Be sure that if you take something exactly
as it appears in another article, book, or

14
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.640
resource, that you treat
it as a direct citation.

15
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.200
it is a best practice to
paraphrase whenever possible and

16
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.640
to avoid direct quotations
unless necessary.

17
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.290
Paraphrasing is one of the hardest
things students have to learn.

18
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.070
It is one of the reasons
students get in trouble for

19
00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.130
plagiarizing, because students do
not always paraphrase properly.

20
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.200
The best way to get better at
paraphrasing is to practice.

21
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.820
Try doing it whenever you take notes from
articles or book chapters you are reading.

22
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.940
Here are some tips on
paraphrasing properly.

23
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.980
Rewrite the sentence using your own words.

24
00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.890
Rewrite it using your
own sentence structure.

25
00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.880
Make sure to keep any distinctive words or
phrases taken from the original source.

26
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.710
This may be a phrase that would not make
sense if you changed anything about it.

27
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.701
For example, a scientific catch-phrase
like cosmological singularity.

28
00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:43.457
You could write out the definition, but

29
00:01:43.457 --> 00:01:45.839
it would make more sense to
just leave the phrase as is.

30
00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.770
Always accurately represent
the author's intent.

31
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.810
You never want to change the tone or
meaning.

32
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.240
If an author positively supports
the topic, and you paraphrase the author's

33
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.190
words to make them sound negative you have
not accurately paraphrased the author.

34
00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.920
Even when you paraphrase, you always want
to cite the source of your information.

35
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.740
The best way to get better at
paraphrasing is to practice.

36
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.150
Let's test our knowledge together on
how to best paraphrase a sentence.

37
00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.240
Which option below is the best
paraphrase of the following sentence?

38
00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.268
Compared to native blood vessels,

39
00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:27.601
all currently available blood vessel
substitutes perform suboptimally.

40
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:29.381
I'll give you a second to
read through the options.
