00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.180
What are examples of academic dishonesty?

2
00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:03.790
Chapter 2.

3
00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.100
Examples of Academic Dishonesty.

4
00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:13.190
Failure to properly cite sources,
even if it's from the Internet.

5
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.380
So this means that you copied
information from the Internet,

6
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.520
partially copied information from
the Internet, used some of the words

7
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.190
from your Internet source, or used some
of the ideas from the Internet source.

8
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.060
Wrote it in your own words, but

9
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.780
you still did not give credit to
the Internet source that you used.

10
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.096
So basically you didn't follow the rules.

11
00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:45.255
And you copy and pasted everything.

12
00:00:48.455 --> 00:00:50.960
The problem here is that
you failed to cite.

13
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.190
Failure to cite means that you did not

14
00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.340
give credit to the original
source that you used.

15
00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.590
You still have to practice honesty and let
your reader know that you used ideas or

16
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:06.650
information that were not your own.

17
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.970
Another example is using
an ungraded assignment.

18
00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.030
So this means that you had
a homework assignment or a project.

19
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.780
It was not submitted, but you still used
the information from that assignment

20
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.750
for another project or another assignment.

21
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.120
You can't do this.

22
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.300
Why?

23
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.040
Because it's being dishonest in
how you gathered the information.

24
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.090
It was not intended for

25
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.020
the original assignment that
you were supposed to submit.

26
00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.790
And you used information from
the course that you did not cite.

27
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.020
Another example of academic
dishonesty is when

28
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.270
you use information provided by
the instructor, such as your class notes,

29
00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.950
your course textbook or your journal
articles, without citing those sources.

30
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.170
So this might sound a little
confusing because this is information

31
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.170
that's provided by your instructor,
so why would you need to cite that?

32
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.315
It's important because you must give
credit to your class notes, the textbook.

33
00:02:15.315 --> 00:02:19.455
Because the ideas outlined in the notes or
in your textbook or

34
00:02:19.455 --> 00:02:22.075
any other course materials
are not your own.

35
00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:25.565
Using information and presenting it
as your own in a homework submission

36
00:02:25.565 --> 00:02:28.480
is violating an academic integrity policy.

37
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.540
You're being dishonest in how you
gathered information for your assignment.

38
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.560
So you must give credit for
all materials used for an assignment.

39
00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.070
So how do you know when to cite or
give credit to a source?

40
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.255
You do it always.

41
00:02:46.255 --> 00:02:48.110
And how do you do it?

42
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.060
That's really important, and after this
video module you will learn how to cite

43
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.610
and when to cite by Ellie Ransom
who works at the libraries.

44
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.410
And it's also important that if you're
unsure on how to cite or when to cite,

45
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.620
you can always ask a librarian.

46
00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.250
And so the librarians here
are Ellie Ransom and Jim.

47
00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.810
Another example is when you use outside

48
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.910
sources when you're not
permitted to do so.

49
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.200
So you use information without
your instructor's permission.

50
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.200
Even if you cited those sources, you have
violated an academic integrity policy

51
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.640
because your instructor did not give
you permission to use outside sources.

52
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.330
Why is this a violation?

53
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.980
It is a violation because the instructor
wanted you to submit original work,

54
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.990
work that was truly your own,
without outside help.

55
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.910
Professors will know if you
use outside information

56
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.700
even if it's information that is
very obscure and hard to find.

57
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.480
Or if it was a friend that
helped you with a problem.

58
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.450
Instructors would have tools, knowledge,

59
00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.920
software, systems in place that can
help identify work that is not original.

60
00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.765
Furthermore, instructors are well read and

61
00:03:59.765 --> 00:04:01.690
knowledgable about
research in their fields.

62
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.350
So if you copied a journal article, or
pulled ideas from an Internet source, or

63
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.180
copied parts of your friend's problem set,

64
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.770
the instructor will know that
it is not your own work.

65
00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.759
So you should also note that
you can't use the Internet

66
00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:20.110
unless you're explicitly
told that you're allowed.

67
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.644
If you search on the Internet,

68
00:04:21.644 --> 00:04:25.220
it's considered cheating if you
have not been given permission.

69
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.180
Another example of academic
dishonesty is when you

70
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.490
submit identical work even if you
were allowed to work in a group.

71
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:41.360
But what was required
was a unique submission,

72
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.110
and you submitted something that
was identical to your collaborator.

73
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.720
So what does this mean?

74
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.100
Why is this a problem?

75
00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.228
By submitting identical work,

76
00:04:52.228 --> 00:04:56.639
then you have violated not only
the rules of academic honesty, but

77
00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.620
you also violated the course guidelines
as instructed by your professor.

78
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.774
Even though you're allowed to work
together on an assignment or a group

79
00:05:05.774 --> 00:05:11.070
research paper, in this case you are still
required to submit your own work.

80
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.070
So you still need permission
from the instructor.

81
00:05:15.558 --> 00:05:19.540
What if you're allowed to submit one
assignment on behalf of the entire group?

82
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.460
What would happen?

83
00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:27.620
For example, your instructor allows
you to submit one script of code or

84
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.630
one research paper on
behalf of your entire team.

85
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.670
Each team member takes on
the responsibility of one part of that

86
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:38.200
research paper or script of code,
so you divide up the work.

87
00:05:40.845 --> 00:05:41.685
What do you do?

88
00:05:41.685 --> 00:05:47.255
How do you maintain academic integrity
while still working in a group together?

89
00:05:49.125 --> 00:05:53.802
You make sure that as a group you review
your assignment together, that you give

90
00:05:53.802 --> 00:05:59.632
credit to all your sources and that you
have consistency in your citation style.

91
00:05:59.632 --> 00:06:02.422
Again, citation goes
back to the word cite.

92
00:06:02.422 --> 00:06:06.832
By citation I mean giving
credit to the original source.

93
00:06:06.832 --> 00:06:10.347
And how you do that you'll
learn in the next video module.

94
00:06:13.047 --> 00:06:15.521
So this also means that your paper or

95
00:06:15.521 --> 00:06:20.820
code is consistent in referencing
all sources of information.

96
00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.550
And just because some parts were
referenced and others were not

97
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.760
does not mean that you have followed
all the academic integrity rules.

98
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:32.100
So it's really important to
maintain consistency in how and

99
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:35.380
where you site in your paper or
project or in your assignment.

100
00:06:37.718 --> 00:06:42.111
So make sure that when you collaborate
you check your team members' work,

101
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:46.853
because you will be found responsible for
an academic integrity violation if one

102
00:06:46.853 --> 00:06:50.775
of your team members does not
follow the academic rules properly.

103
00:06:51.965 --> 00:06:55.665
Another example is copying
another student's work or

104
00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.425
allowing a student to copy your own.

105
00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.320
Lending your assignment or copying
another student's work is dishonest.

106
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.270
Don't send copies of your
assignment to other students.

107
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.550
Why is this a problem?

108
00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.930
It is a problem because you're
dishonest about your work,

109
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.910
since it's not originally solved by you.

110
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.880
You're essentially breaking
the rules of academic integrity

111
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.500
by being dishonest in how you collected or
gathered your information.

112
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:26.080
Now we all want to help each other.

113
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.780
But as discussed in previous examples,

114
00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:32.270
if you're not allowed by the instructor
to collaborate on an assignment or

115
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.280
an exam, then you cannot share
your original work with others.

116
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.680
Sharing your work and copying your
classmate's process on how she or

117
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.700
he solved the problem is being dishonest.

118
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.060
Your process in solving a problem,
meaning how you arrived to your answer or

119
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.130
conclusion, is uniquely your own.

120
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.470
Even if you were not
the person who copied,

121
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.510
but you were the person who
shared your assignment,

122
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:58.220
you would be found responsible for
violating an academic integrity rule.

123
00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:01.760
This happens when students are running
out of time, and decide to email or

124
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:06.280
hand their homework to a classmate who
is having trouble with an assignment.

125
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.840
Bad idea, don't do it.

126
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:13.050
Other instances of copying
can happen during an exam.

127
00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:15.950
Looking over a classmate's exam or

128
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:20.630
allowing another student to look at your
exam is a violation of academic integrity.

129
00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.272
Again, if your instructor does not
give you permission to collaborate,

130
00:08:24.272 --> 00:08:27.520
then you cannot help or
seek help from a classmate during an exam.

131
00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:34.600
This means you cannot use the Internet,
your mobile phone, class notes or

132
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.280
any other materials that are not
permitted by the instructor.

133
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.060
If you're having trouble
with an assignment or

134
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:42.700
an exam, it is better to
partially complete the exam or

135
00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.120
the assignment than to be caught
violating an academic integrity policy.

136
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.060
Another example of academic
dishonesty would be

137
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:57.460
altering a grade or altering a graded
exam in an effort to regain points.

138
00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:03.220
Attempting to change your grade on an exam
after you have received a grade and/or

139
00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:08.340
telling the instructor that the exam was
graded incorrectly is being dishonest.

140
00:09:08.340 --> 00:09:10.820
The instructor keeps
copies of graded exams.

141
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.850
Trying to regain a couple of extra points
will land you in a great deal of trouble.

142
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:15.940
Don't be foolish.

143
00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.020
Another example is forging
another person's signature or

144
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:21.180
pretending to be someone else.

145
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:25.670
Some exams or assignments will require you
to sign a cover sheet to acknowledge that

146
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:28.940
all the work you submitted was your own.

147
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.500
Forging someone's signature is a bad idea.

148
00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.450
Taking an exam for a friend and
signing it with their name is dishonest.

149
00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.620
You have violated an academic
integrity policy and

150
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.670
it could jeopardize your entire career.

151
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:47.520
You would definitely be called in a for
a dean's disciplinary hearing.

152
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.820
You will get reported.

153
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:55.260
So another example of
academic dishonesty is

154
00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:00.750
submitting the same assignment in two
different courses without the permission

155
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:01.940
of both instructors.

156
00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.240
So this is called self-plagiarism.

157
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:08.330
In the next academic
integrity video requirement,

158
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:12.030
you will learn in more detail about
plagiarism and self-plagiarism.

159
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.200
However, for this presentation we
will focus on a case scenario to

160
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.420
illustrate the definition
of self-plagiarism.

161
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:23.520
So as you can see right here, for
example, this is a little cartoon and

162
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:28.890
in this case it's a student and
the student forgot that

163
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:34.570
they have this big project to do, and
it's due and they're pressed for time.

164
00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.040
And so the student's thinking,

165
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:40.610
hm, maybe I could use, or
just reuse a project from last year.

166
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.360
So this would be called self-plagiarism.

167
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.365
This would mean that you
are being academically dishonest.

168
00:10:49.915 --> 00:10:52.285
And why would this be wrong?

169
00:10:52.285 --> 00:10:54.695
Why can't you use
a project from last year?

170
00:10:54.695 --> 00:10:56.425
So we're gonna do a case scenario.

171
00:10:56.425 --> 00:10:59.435
So for example,
you have two different courses.

172
00:10:59.435 --> 00:11:03.210
One is in Solid Biomechanics,
the other's in Mechanics of Fluids.

173
00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:09.060
The instructor in Mechanics
gives you an assignment

174
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:14.270
that is very similar to an assignment
in Mechanics of Fluids.

175
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:18.960
If you decide to submit your entire
homework or portions of the assignment

176
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:25.160
from Solid Biomechanics to your professor
who's teaching Mechanics of Fluids,

177
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.460
you would be committing
an academic integrity violation.

178
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:29.960
Why?

179
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:39.820
The reason why it's a violation of
academic integrity is that the work

180
00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:44.700
that was submitted was not originally
intended for Mechanics of Fluids.

181
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:49.180
The assignment was originally intended for
your Solid Biomechanics course.

182
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:52.410
So both instructors can report
you to the dean's office.

183
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:56.121
So does this mean you can never
use materials from past or

184
00:11:56.121 --> 00:11:59.770
concurrent research and/or courses?

185
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:04.410
No, you just need to ask permission
from both instructors and

186
00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:07.380
you would have to cite or
give credit to yourself and

187
00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:12.970
reference your research that
you did in your course or

188
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:16.890
in your previous course or
in the courses that you are taking.

189
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:22.150
So it's very important to ask
permission before you submit work

190
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.410
that you've previously
submitted in another course.

191
00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.670
Faculty will know if you have not
submitted original work for their course.

192
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:32.100
Instructors are colleagues and
are aware of each other's courses.

193
00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:35.730
So all you would need to do is to ask for
permission and

194
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:37.720
properly cite your previous assignment.

195
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.820
This goes back to following
the instructor's course policies and

196
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.960
knowing the rules.

197
00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:47.946
Please make sure to answer the questions
before you start chapter 3.
