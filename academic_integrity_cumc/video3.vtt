1
00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.110
What happens when you break
academic integrity rules?

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:04.825
Chapter 3.

3
00:00:04.825 --> 00:00:10.370
A faculty, staff or classmate can
report an academic integrity violation.

4
00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.920
The report is submitted
to the Dean's office.

5
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.670
You can find the academic integrity
violation report on the graduate

6
00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.960
engineering website under the student
affairs home page by going to contact.

7
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.970
And you'll see report
an academic integrity violation.

8
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.260
Additionally, faculty are required to
report all suspected incidents of academic

9
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.390
dishonesty.

10
00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.270
Why?

11
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.560
Because it ensures consistency
in findings and sanctioning.

12
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.270
This means that if you
cheat in several classes,

13
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.170
we can track your violations, which can
determine the severity of our decision and

14
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.240
how it will impact your academic status.

15
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.220
So what happens when a report is made?

16
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.040
The Office of Graduate Student Affairs
receives the incident report from

17
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.550
an instructor, department staff,
TA or classmate.

18
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.250
A student receives an email
notification from GSA with the date and

19
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.870
time of the hearing.

20
00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.420
The hearing is a meeting which gives
the student who is accused of violating

21
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.800
an academic integrity policy,
an opportunity to share her or

22
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.250
his side of the story.

23
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.980
Why is this important?

24
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.890
Because GSA gathers as much information
as possible, including information from

25
00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.430
the student who is caught violating
an academic integrity policy so

26
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.320
that they can make
a better decision on what

27
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.480
should happen to the academic
status of the student.

28
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.870
A student who fails to attend the meeting
forfeits the opportunity to share her or

29
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.180
his perspective on what happened.

30
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.640
As a result, it forces GSA to make
a decision without the student's input.

31
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.380
Please note that missing
the e-mail notification does not

32
00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.970
excuse a student's absence
during a disciplinary hearing.

33
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.220
It is the responsibility of the student
to read her or his e-mails.

34
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.203
During the hearing, there are two
GSA officers, usually myself and

35
00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:02.607
another officer, such as Fred Sanchez,

36
00:02:02.607 --> 00:02:05.790
our Assistant Director of
Graduate Student Affairs.

37
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.840
And we would be conducting the hearing.

38
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.010
And once we have collected enough
information about the incident,

39
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.430
our office decides on a sanction or

40
00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.210
an outcome that would impact the student's
status, if they were found responsible.

41
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.340
A sanction is an outcome that affects
the student's academic record.

42
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.280
What are the possible sanctions?

43
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.520
Possible sanctions could be a warning,

44
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.580
which is when a letter is placed
on the students file, and

45
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.910
if no other incidents occur,
the letter is removed upon graduation.

46
00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.860
This sanction is not indicated on
the transcript, and it is not reported.

47
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.630
Probation is a possible outcome.

48
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.770
Again, this is all depending
on the severity of the case.

49
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.840
And if it's multiple
incidences of cheating.

50
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.100
So, probation is when a letter is
placed in the student's file, and

51
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.490
it remains there permanently.

52
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.210
If the student gives written permission
to a person or institution to review

53
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.690
the file, the sanction and
the violation will be reported.

54
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.910
This sanction is not indicated on the
transcripts, so this is very important.

55
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.777
So what does this all mean.

56
00:03:06.777 --> 00:03:10.669
It means that say, if you were caught and

57
00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:17.083
you were found responsible for
an academic integrity violation,

58
00:03:17.083 --> 00:03:23.090
and you apply to a job that
was a high-security-level job.

59
00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.695
So that means, for example, that you
are applying to either the FBI, the CIA,

60
00:03:28.695 --> 00:03:33.799
or some kind of position where not only
is there an interview process that

61
00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.905
investigates your skills, but
there's also an interview process that

62
00:03:38.905 --> 00:03:44.576
investigates your character,
your ethics, and your moral compass.

63
00:03:44.576 --> 00:03:50.240
Then you would have to be,
you would have to authorize the company

64
00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.550
to get access to your information,

65
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.540
or previous information that you've had at
different institutions and organizations.

66
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.740
And that character analysis is usually
done, because [INAUDIBLE] at the position

67
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.490
that you would be applying to is
a position where a lot of confidential

68
00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:15.200
information and
data is being shared with you.

69
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.360
And so they really need
someone that can be trusted.

70
00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.830
And so this is,
a background check would happen.

71
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.630
And again,

72
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.210
it's important to note that a background
check can only happen if you give

73
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.920
permission to the outside organization
to run a background check on you.

74
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:40.450
It's important also for you to remember
that if you do give that authority or

75
00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:44.870
authorization, to an organization
that's running the background check,

76
00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:52.700
then we are obligated to report whatever
sanction was made on your record.

77
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.180
So suspension is another outcome that
could impact your academic status.

78
00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.050
Suspension is when we ask you to leave for

79
00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.070
a period of time, and
it does reflect in your transcripts.

80
00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.530
And so if you were to get your transcripts
printed and send it to an employer or

81
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.660
send it to another academic institution,
you're transcripts would be flagged

82
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:23.700
as having a disciplinary
action taken on your record.

83
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.880
So another outcome is dismissal.This
decision is also permanent.

84
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.840
We ask the student to
leave the university.

85
00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.180
Dismissal due to academic disciplinary
issues is noted on the transcript and

86
00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.330
in the student records.

87
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.010
So it's permanent.

88
00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.090
Please note that for

89
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.700
the last three sanctions, if a potential
employer runs a background check and

90
00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:50.460
asks our office about the academic or
behavioral issues on your record.

91
00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.020
We are obligated to report
a disciplinary issue if there are any.

92
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.200
So again, it's a reminder.

93
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.180
This is another good
reason why you should get

94
00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:02.950
in the habit of practicing
academic integrity.

95
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.800
Now bear in mind that a Dean's
disciplinary decision is separate from

96
00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.470
an instructor's decision
on the student's grade.

97
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.130
The instructor can decide to give
the student in question an F

98
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:16.090
in the entire course or
a zero on an exam or the assignment.

99
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:19.540
A Dean's disciplinary decision has no
bearing on the instructor's decision of

100
00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.230
the student's grade in the course,
exam or in the assignment.

101
00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:25.810
FInally, our decisions are decided
on a case-by-case basis and

102
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.910
are dependent upon evidence
that supports the allegation.

103
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.840
Ways to avoid academic dishonesty.

104
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.470
When in doubt about policies, just ask.

105
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.920
It's better to ask,
then to go ahead and make assumptions.

106
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.440
It's never good to make assumptions
about a policy that's in your course.

107
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.730
Or a school policy, or
a university policy.

108
00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.350
So it's better to ask before you go ahead.

109
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.200
With whatever decision you decide to make.

110
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:56.990
So when you ask, you should ask
an instructor, a TA, an advisor, or

111
00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.910
our office.

112
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.050
Never ask a friend, because they
might be just as informed as you are.

113
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:07.020
And if you're desperate for help, you can
visit our office during office hours, or

114
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.860
email the instructor, or email the TA,
or talk either one of them.

115
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.740
And again, do not go to other students for
assistance.

116
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:21.150
If you're running out of time,
ask for an extension.

117
00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:22.310
It can't hurt to ask.

118
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:26.290
So what happens is that a lot
of students get into trouble,

119
00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.380
because they're running out of time.

120
00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:34.970
And they decide to quickly write
an assignment or submitting homework

121
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:39.930
without going through the proper
channels or asking the right questions.

122
00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:45.060
And they make mistakes and they end
up violating some academic policies.

123
00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:50.119
So it's better to ask for an extension
if you're running out of time,

124
00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:55.095
than just to submit work that's not
following the course policies or

125
00:07:55.095 --> 00:07:57.861
the university and school policies.

126
00:07:57.861 --> 00:08:02.366
The consequences of submitting incomplete
or incorrect work are much less severe

127
00:08:02.366 --> 00:08:06.070
than those resulting from
incidences of academic dishonesty.

128
00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:09.622
Please make sure to answer the questions
before you watch the next chapter.

129
00:08:09.622 --> 00:08:10.900
Conclusion.

130
00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:15.410
So let's quickly go over some of
the major key points that we covered in

131
00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:16.550
the video module.

132
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.830
It's important to be honest in
how you gather information.

133
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:23.770
You should follow course policies.

134
00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:30.690
Another important key point is to give
credit to all information you use and

135
00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:35.830
that can be anything such as class notes,
textbooks, journals, websites,

136
00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:41.650
any outside information that you use, any
information that's not your original idea,

137
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.980
you must give credit to
the source of information.

138
00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.614
If you're not sure about an academic
policy, ask the instructor or the TA.

139
00:08:49.614 --> 00:08:53.890
Academic integrity is critical to
your experience here at Columbia.

140
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:58.160
To be a member of the Columbia community,
you must adhere to the academic integrity

141
00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.080
policies of the university and
the School of Engineering.

142
00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:05.670
As a Columbia student, it is important
to not only practice academic integrity,

143
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:09.660
which is the act of being honest in your
work and following your course rules, but

144
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:14.550
is just as important to promote
academic integrity to your peers.

145
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.269
You represent Columbia and its values.

146
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:21.516
Your academic integrity values will
prepare you for a successful academic and

147
00:09:21.516 --> 00:09:23.580
professional career.

148
00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:27.980
Employers look for reliable,
dependable, trustworthy employees.

149
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:31.360
If you cannot practice integrity
in an academic setting

150
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.280
then you are unprepared for your future
professional and academic experiences.

151
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.420
Finally, if you are caught violating
an academic integrity policy you

152
00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.580
should understand that your
violation impacts your peers.

153
00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.910
Cheating not only negatively
impacts your credibility,

154
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:49.620
but it also effects grading scales,
research course expectations,

155
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:54.460
assignments and the overall management
of a course or a research project.

156
00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:58.090
This concludes part one of
the academic integrity video.

157
00:09:58.090 --> 00:10:02.331
The next presentation, citation management
will provide tools, methods, and

158
00:10:02.331 --> 00:10:05.904
resources on how to properly give
credit to sources of information.

159
00:10:09.273 --> 00:10:11.560
What are examples of academic dishonesty?

160
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.320
Chapter 2.

161
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.480
Examples of academic dishonesty.

162
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.730
Failure to properly cite sources,
even if it's from the Internet.

163
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.740
So, this means that you copied
information from the Internet,

164
00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.880
partially copied information from
the Internet, used some of the words

165
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:38.560
from your Internet source, or used some
of the ideas from the Internet source.

166
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.420
Wrote it in your own words, but

167
00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.150
you still did not give credit to
the Internet source that you used.

168
00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.770
So basically you didn't follow the rules.

169
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.458
And you copy and pasted everything.

170
00:10:57.674 --> 00:11:00.320
The problem here is that
you failed to cite.

171
00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.550
Failure to cite means that you did not

172
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:09.710
give credit to the original
source that you used.

173
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:14.436
You still have to practice honesty and
let your reader know

174
00:11:14.436 --> 00:11:19.173
that you used ideas or
information that were not your own.

175
00:11:19.173 --> 00:11:23.250
Another example is using
an ungraded assignment.

176
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:29.400
So this means that you had
a homework assignment, or a project,

177
00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:35.070
it was not submitted but you still used
the information from that assignment

178
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:39.080
for another project or another assignment.

179
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:40.366
You can't do this.

180
00:11:40.366 --> 00:11:41.670
Why?

181
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:45.410
Because it's being dishonest in
how you gathered the information.

182
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:48.050
It was not intended for the original
assignment that you were supposed to

183
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:54.160
submit and you used information from
the course that you did not cite.

184
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:59.410
Another example of academic
dishonesty is when you

185
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:04.640
use information provided by
the instructor, such as your class notes,

186
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:10.320
your course textbook, or your journal
articles, without citing those sources.

187
00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:14.643
So this might sound a little confusing,
because this is information that's

188
00:12:14.643 --> 00:12:18.311
provided by your instructor, so
why would you need to cite that?

189
00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:22.749
It's important because you must
give credit to your class notes,

190
00:12:22.749 --> 00:12:26.394
the textbook because the ideas
outlined in the notes or

191
00:12:26.394 --> 00:12:31.440
in your textbook, or any other
course materials are not your own.

192
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.930
Using information and presenting it
as your own in a homework submission

193
00:12:34.930 --> 00:12:37.840
is violating an academic integrity policy.

194
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:44.798
You're being dishonest in how you
gathered information for your assignment.

195
00:12:44.798 --> 00:12:47.930
So you must give credit to all
materials used for an assignment.

196
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.272
So how do you know when to cite,
or give credit to a source?

197
00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:55.610
You do it always.

198
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:57.480
And how do you do it?

199
00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.570
That's really important, and after this
video module you'll learn how to cite and

200
00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:08.450
when to cite by Ellie Ransom
who works at the libraries.

201
00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:13.190
And it's also important that if
you're unsure on how to cite or

202
00:13:13.190 --> 00:13:15.290
when to cite,
you can always ask a librarian.

203
00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.620
And so the librarians here
are Ellie Ransom and Jim.

204
00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.445
Another example is when you use sources,

205
00:13:24.445 --> 00:13:28.260
outside sources when you're
not permitted to do so.

206
00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.560
So, you use information without
your instructor's permission,

207
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.560
even if you cited those sources, you have
violated an academic integrity policy,

208
00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.010
because your instructor did not give
you permission to use outside sources.

209
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:42.720
Why is this a violation?

210
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:48.310
It is a violation because the instructor
wanted you to submit original work,

211
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.350
work that was truly your
own without outside help.

212
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:54.100
Professors will know if you
use outside information,

213
00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.190
even if it's information that is
very obscure and hard to find, or

214
00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:00.850
if it was a friend that
helped you with that problem.

215
00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.820
Instructors would have tools, knowledge,

216
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.150
software, systems in place that can
help identify work that is not original.

217
00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:09.900
Furthermore, instructors are well-read and
knowledgeable about

218
00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:12.830
research in their field, so
if you copied a journal article or

219
00:14:12.830 --> 00:14:16.540
pulled ideas from an Internet source or
copied parts of your friend's problem set,

220
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.130
the instructor will know that
it is not your own work.

221
00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:24.239
So you should also note that
you can't use the Internet

222
00:14:24.239 --> 00:14:29.480
unless you're explicitly
told that you're allowed.

223
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.990
If you search on the Internet,

224
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:34.580
it's considered cheating if you
have not been given permission.

225
00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:42.813
Another example of academic dishonesty
is when you submit identical work.

226
00:14:42.813 --> 00:14:47.769
Even if you are allowed to work in a group
but what was required was a unique

227
00:14:47.769 --> 00:14:53.470
submission and you submitted something
that was identical to your collaborator.

228
00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.812
So, what does this mean?

229
00:14:57.812 --> 00:14:59.470
Why is this a problem?

230
00:14:59.470 --> 00:15:01.860
By submitting identical work,

231
00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:06.220
then you have violated not only the rules
of academic honesty, but you have

232
00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:10.158
also violated the course guidelines
as instructed by your professor.

233
00:15:10.158 --> 00:15:14.972
Even though you're allowed to work
together on an assignment or a group

234
00:15:14.972 --> 00:15:20.200
research paper, in this case you are still
required to submit your own work.

235
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.460
So you still need permission
from the instructor.

236
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.840
What if you are allowed to submit one
assignment on behalf of the entire group?

237
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.780
What would happen?

238
00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:36.990
For example, your instructor allows
you to submit one script of code or

239
00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.990
one research paper on
behalf of your entire team.

240
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:43.410
Each team member takes
on the responsibility of

241
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:46.460
one part of that research paper or
scripts of code.

242
00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:47.560
So you divide up the work.

243
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:50.851
What do you do?

244
00:15:50.851 --> 00:15:56.573
How do you maintain academic integrity
while still working in a group together?

245
00:15:56.573 --> 00:16:01.489
You make sure that as a group,
you review your assignment together,

246
00:16:01.489 --> 00:16:04.709
that you give credit to all your sources,
and

247
00:16:04.709 --> 00:16:09.000
that you have consistency
in your citation style.

248
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.150
Again, citation goes back to the word,
cite.

249
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:15.099
And by citation, I mean giving
credit to the original source.

250
00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.420
And how you'll do that,
you'll learn in the next video module.

251
00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.872
So this also means that your paper or

252
00:16:24.872 --> 00:16:30.190
code is consistent in referencing
all sources of information.

253
00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.910
And just because some parts were
referenced and others were not

254
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:36.130
does not mean that you have followed
all of the academic integrity rules.

255
00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:41.420
So it's really important to
maintain consistency in how and

256
00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.700
where you cite in your paper or
project or in your assignment.

257
00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:51.020
So make sure that when you collaborate
you check your team member's work

258
00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.480
because you will be found responsible for
an academic integrity violation if one of

259
00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:00.085
your team members does not follow
the academic rules properly.

260
00:17:01.325 --> 00:17:05.035
Another example is copying
another student's work or

261
00:17:05.035 --> 00:17:06.785
allowing a student to copy your own.

262
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:12.660
Lending your assignment, or copying
another student's work is dishonest.

263
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.640
Don't send copies of your
assignment to other students.

264
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:17.910
Why is this a problem?

265
00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:22.300
It is a problem because you
are dishonest about your work,

266
00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:24.280
since it's not originally solved by you.

267
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.250
You're essentially breaking
the rules of academic integrity

268
00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:32.870
by being dishonest in how you collected or
gathered your information.

269
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.140
Now we all want to help each other,
but as discussed in previous examples,

270
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:41.640
if you're not allowed by the instructor
to collaborate on an assignment or

271
00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.640
an exam, then you cannot share
your original work with others.

272
00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.050
Sharing your work and copying your
classmates process on how she or

273
00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:52.060
he solved the problem is being dishonest.

274
00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.650
Your process in solving a problem,

275
00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:58.490
meaning how you arrived to your answer
conclusion, is uniquely your own.

276
00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:02.680
Even if you are not the person who copied,
but you were the person who shared your

277
00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:07.630
assignment, you would be found responsible
for violating an academic integrity rule.

278
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:11.140
This happens when students are running
out of time, and decide to email or

279
00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:15.640
hand their homework to a classmate who
is having trouble with an assignment.

280
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.210
Bad idea, don't do it.

281
00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:22.330
Other instances of copying
can happen during an exam.

282
00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.272
Looking over a classmate's exam or

283
00:18:24.272 --> 00:18:28.880
allowing another student to look at your
exam is a violation of academic integrity.

284
00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.107
Again, if your instructor does not
give you permission to collaborate,

285
00:18:33.107 --> 00:18:36.870
then you cannot help or
seek help from a classmate during an exam.

286
00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:43.970
This means you cannot use the internet,
your mobile phone, class notes, or

287
00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:46.640
any other materials that are not
permitted by the instructor.

288
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.430
If you're having trouble
with an assignment or

289
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:52.080
an exam, it is better to
partially complete the exam or

290
00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.490
the assignment then to be caught
violating academic integrity policy.

291
00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:01.420
Another example of academic
dishonesty would be

292
00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:06.820
altering a grade or altering a graded
exam in an effort to regain points.

293
00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:12.590
Attempting to change your grade on an exam
after you have received a grade or

294
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:17.700
telling the instructor that the exam was
graded incorrectly is being dishonest.

295
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.190
The instructor keeps
copies of graded exams.

296
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:24.220
Trying to gain a couple of extra points
will land you in a great deal of trouble.

297
00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.310
Don't be foolish.

298
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.410
Another example is forging
another person's signature or

299
00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.550
pretending to be someone else.

300
00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:35.030
Some exams or assignments will require you
to sign a cover sheet to acknowledge that

301
00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:38.310
all the work that you
submitted was your own.

302
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.190
Forging someone's signature is a bad idea.

303
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:46.810
Taking an exam for a friend and signing
it with their name is being dishonest.

304
00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:49.990
You have violated an academic
integrity policy, and

305
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:52.070
it could jeopardize your entire career.

306
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:56.810
You would definitely be called in for
a dean's disciplinary hearing.

307
00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:00.180
You will get reported.

308
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:03.270
So another example of academic dishonesty

309
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:08.630
is submitting the same
assignment in two different

310
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:11.310
courses without the permission
of both instructors.

311
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.550
So, this is called self-plagiarism.

312
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:17.710
In the next academic
integrity video requirement,

313
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:20.690
you will learn in more detail about
plagiarism and self plagiarism.

314
00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:24.560
However, for this presentation,
we will focus on a case scenario to

315
00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.150
illustrate the definition
of self-plagiarism.

316
00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:30.330
So, as you can see right here,
for example.

317
00:20:30.330 --> 00:20:35.470
It's a little cartoon, and
in this case, it's a student,

318
00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:41.170
and the student forgot that they
have this big project to do.

319
00:20:41.170 --> 00:20:43.940
And it's due, and
they're pressed for time.

320
00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.400
And so the student's thinking,

321
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:49.980
hm, maybe I could use or
just re-use a project from last year.

322
00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:53.960
So this would be called self-plagiarism,

323
00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:57.730
this would mean that you
are being academically dishonest.

324
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.650
And why would this be wrong?

325
00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:04.060
Why can't you use
a project from last year?

326
00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.060
So we're gonna do a case scenario.

327
00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.790
So for example,
you have two different courses.

328
00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:12.550
One is in Solid Biomechanics,
the other is in Mechanics of Fluids.

329
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:18.390
The instructor in Mechanics
gives you an assignment

330
00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:23.630
that is very similar to an assignment
in Mechanics of Fluids.

331
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:28.060
If you decide to submit your entire
homework or portions of the assignment

332
00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:34.560
from Solid Biomechanics to your professor
who's teaching Mechanics of Fluids,

333
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:38.830
you would be committing
an academic integrity violation.

334
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:39.330
Why?

335
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:46.720
Because, the reason why it's
a violation of academic integrity,

336
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:52.280
is that the work that was submitted
was not originally intended for

337
00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.060
Mechanics of Fluids.

338
00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:58.550
The assignment was originally intended for
your Solid Biomechanics course.

339
00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.780
So both instructors can report
you to the dean's office.

340
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.185
So, does this mean you can never
use materials from past or

341
00:22:05.185 --> 00:22:07.559
con current research and/or courses?

342
00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:13.770
No, you just need to ask
permission from both instructors.

343
00:22:13.770 --> 00:22:16.760
And you would have to cite or
give credit to yourself and

344
00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:22.660
reference your research that you
did in your previous course or

345
00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:26.280
in the courses that you are taking.

346
00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:31.520
So it's very important to ask
permission before you submit work

347
00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.780
that you have previously
submitted in another course.

348
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:38.040
Faculty will know if you have not
submitted original work for their course.

349
00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.460
Instructors are colleagues and
are aware of each other's courses.

350
00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.980
So all you would need to do is ask for

351
00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.090
permission and
properly cite your previous assignment.

352
00:22:47.090 --> 00:22:50.180
This goes back to following
the instructor's course policies and

353
00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.330
knowing the rules.

354
00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:55.680
Please make sure to answer the questions
before you start Chapter 3.
