1
00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.410
Which answer did you choose?

2
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:04.380
If you picked B, you are correct.

3
00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.920
Let's break down the other answers
to see why they are wrong.

4
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.240
Choice A deleted portions of the sentence,

5
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.510
which is not enough to be
considered properly paraphrased.

6
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:16.300
In deleting sections of the sentence,

7
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.840
this option has actually
changed the meaning entirely.

8
00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.940
Choice C changed compared
to to in contrast,

9
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.080
deleted currently, and
changed suboptimally to bad.

10
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.790
This is not a correct paraphrase,
as the writer only changed a few words but

11
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.089
did not restructure the sentence.

12
00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.400
Choice D only transposed
the two parts of the sentence.

13
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.500
If you will read choice B again, you will
see the author used their own words and

14
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.260
sentence structure to portray
the same concept and meaning.

15
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.930
Citing your sources in a paper, article,
or presentation requires two steps.

16
00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.670
First, you must include a citation
within the text of your paper.

17
00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.260
Depending on the citation style you use,

18
00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.570
this may take the form of a superscript
number, a number in brackets, or

19
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.640
the author's name and
date of publication in parentheses.

20
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.170
The second step requires you to include
a bibliography at the end of your paper.

21
00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.260
A bibliography is the full list of
resources used in writing your paper

22
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.600
with all identifying information or
metadata about each source.

23
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.240
This can also be labeled References or
work cited.

24
00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.370
What type of in-text citation you use and

25
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.470
the layout of your bibliography
depends on the citation style.

26
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.550
What style you use depends on
what your professor suggests,

27
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.430
which will probably relate
to your field of study.

28
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.930
The style you use could also depend on
the journal you're trying to publish in.

29
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.600
Here are some examples of
different citation styles.

30
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.220
This is IEEE.

31
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.840
This style is used by all IEEE journals,
and

32
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.920
is often used in electrical
engineering research.

33
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.300
The in-text citation
is a bracketed number.

34
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.530
The bibliography is included
at the end of your paper, and

35
00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.380
resources are listed in order
of appearance in your paper.

36
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.600
This is the American Psychological Society
or APA style.

37
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.840
This style is often used in psychological
or other social science research.

38
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.470
The in-text citation is the authors'
names followed by a comma and

39
00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.150
the year of publication in parentheses.

40
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.110
The bibliography is included
at the end of your paper, and

41
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.690
resources are listed alphabetically
by the first author's last name.

42
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.600
There are many different styles.

43
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.580
Be sure to choose the one best suited for
your needs and

44
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.390
keep the style consistent
throughout your paper.

45
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.600
Please refer to the style guide for
all the nuances for each type of resource.

46
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.530
Remember to stay organized
while doing your research, so

47
00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.380
you remember what sources
you need to cite.

48
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.075
While taking notes, make sure to write
down the citation for each article or

49
00:02:49.075 --> 00:02:51.925
book chapter you are reading
before jotting down those notes.

50
00:02:53.175 --> 00:02:57.655
The best way to keep track of all your
references is to use a reference manager.

51
00:02:57.655 --> 00:03:02.405
The three that Columbia Libraries
recommend are EndNote,

52
00:03:02.405 --> 00:03:04.312
Mendeley, or Zotero.

53
00:03:04.312 --> 00:03:08.672
Using a reference manager allows you
to easily place in-text citations,

54
00:03:08.672 --> 00:03:13.152
create bibliographies, and to change
between different citation styles.

55
00:03:13.152 --> 00:03:15.772
You can read more about each tool
by following the link below.

56
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.390
Remember that proper citations
are expected within papers,

57
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:27.440
articles, presentations,
posters, websites, and code.

58
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.390
Always cite your sources
using proper citation styles.

59
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.240
Paraphrasing can be difficult,
so practice.

60
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.190
Poorly paraphrased ideas
are still considered plagiarism.

61
00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.940
Use citation management software to stay
organized and to help you cite properly.

62
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.307
